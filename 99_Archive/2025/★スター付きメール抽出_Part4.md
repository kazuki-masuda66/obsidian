Colin,

Thank you for sharing this. I believe this element will become a key

content of a bid in the near future.

We will further talk with GHQ folks about the potential needs of

Emission data input.

Just FYI below.

This should be one of the selling point of Eagle X for NA Sales (other

region's Sales as well) as TT tool provides us with CO2 information.

Omori san,

Many thanks for your feedback.

Well noted that NA marketing prefer to proceed with the current Notepad at

the Game Planning stage without changing to the Supplementary sheet

prepared by HKG GCSM.

Since I received feedback from Trades in other regions that they need this

kind of sheet removing redundant information, we will consider what the

best way will be. (At least, will proceed based on your intention)

こちらをもとに、ベンの方でCustomer Masterをアップデートして、アカウント登録を進めて頂く理解でよろしかったでしょうか。

また、分析に関しては、

・既にこちら

・一旦JPSYMに差異の確認させていただいておりますが、Contractデータがおかしい点は言われており、じゃあどうする？を検討する必要はありそうです。そちらも追加で安斎さんへご質問させていただいてはおります

Nakai san, Masuda san & Flourance,

We would like to share the updated tender calendar which was updated and

consolidated upon collaborative efforts with RHQ Tender Management.

All Regions have concluded the list except NAM.  We will update you further

once NAM completes their exercise.

\*Number of tenders in the list (as of today)\*

Total: \*1,078 tenders\* in FY25 (incl. GKA/RKA/LKA/ONECare offshore &

onshore tenders)

NAM : 355 tenders (in which 225 tenders confirmed and 130 tenders pending

from CRO)

EAS :  319 tenders (confirmed)

EUA :  249 tenders (confirmed)

LAT  :    93 tenders (confirmed)

SAS :    57 tenders (confirmed)

WAS :     5 tenders (confirmed)

Kindly be reminded that GCSM has defined "Tender" with the following

criteria to segregate from normal RFQs or NAC.

I acknowledge this is the gap from the scope of Eagle X.

\*"BCO Tender" Specify Definition (required reporting to the Tender

Calendar)\*

1\) Contract Type : BCO / Direct / Shipper's Association  (\*excluding\* NVO

Name Account)

2\) Contract Period : one year or above (\*including\* 1H/2H 6-month review)

3\) Customers provide formal Invitation via portal or excel spreadsheet or

tender documents

4\) Customers provide tender schedule / timeline

Feel free to ask if anything is unclear.

ただ、Early

こちらですが、OPUS Contractを出すとなると時間がかかりますが、そこは正直後回しでもいいのでは？と考えており、

Furthermore, will prioritise the account list for Pre-study by month to

monitor progress.

Masuda san and Conversion team will reach out to TST shortly as we will

Thank you for the summary below.

Can you please elaborate further on Pending items.

Does the "Traditional Case" mean that we could not proceed via Eagle X due

to some reasons (e.g. unworkable customer format etc) ?

Terada san,

Thank you for recapping the discussed points.

Nakai san, Masuda san,

As discussed, the process lead time of Eagle X vs timeframe given by

customers is a key dependency in the live phase.

Therefore, it's very important to standardize the processing time so that

all stakeholders get clear to judge whether to go with Eagle X or not

without confusion.

The guideline should include:-

\- The standard process timeline

\- The decision making process to handle exceptional/unexpected cases

GCSM is working to finalize our proposal and submitting to you shortly.

Let's set a follow up discussion to get an alignment.

Regarding Scope of Eagle X, I'm not confident to get Sales convinced with

the direction of "all long term contracts" including general type of RFQs.

Those RFQs shall include spot, one or a few lane(s) only without a tender

format, no uniformed process and timeline. And more importantly, Sales

can't anticipate when to receive it from customers.

I'm afraid that it would sacrifice efficiency in terms of workload, lead

time and more complex process if Sales really have to handle any long term

RFQs with Eagle X.

I feel it's important for us to reach out to the definition of "what is

tender?", which should be aligned with the scope of Eagle X as well as

Tender Calendar.

Hopefully we can continue the discussion to reach a mutual conclusion..

仲井さん、増田さん

下記に関して二点、後ほどご相談させて頂けますでしょうか。

\*１．GCSM Calendarに入っていない対象について\*

１）Rate Inquiry

・これは難儀ですね。含めないと、どのシステムでも把握できないものとなる気がしていますので、原則含めるというのがEagle Xとしての立場だと思っています

・とりあえず、今別途で分析しているTender Calendar vs Contract

Masterで対象を把握したうえで議論ですかね。対象を明確にしたうえで、そのLiftingを調べてかなりマイナーとなればイレギュラーケースという扱いもいいとは思いますが。

２）POST Tender

・ここは、TigerのAmendmendなどが機能するのであればEagle

X対象外としてもいい気がしてきたのですが、いかがでしょうか。Tigerの現状を少し理解しきれていないかもしれませんが、ShortなどはTigerが機能しているという理解でした

・ただし、来年以降も考慮するために、どうやってTender DBに登録するのか？する必要があるのか？という検討が必要かと思ってはいます

\*２．Pending items.の "Traditional Case"について\*

・これは、we could not proceed via Eagle X due to some reasons (e.g. unworkable

customer format etc)という理解であっています

・で、このケースは後からコンバージョンしてもらうということは話していましたが、結局それをどうやってCVAデータなどに昇華するかがPendingと思っています。

カテゴリー分けすると、下記二つですが、どちらもRevenue

LaneなどをSalesに手入力してもらわないとCVAに登録できない問題があるので、この辺りをどう解決するか？を検討する必要があると考えております。今、まだ名案は思い付いていない状況です

\- 時間切れ

\- 複雑で難しい

Dear Flourance,

They asked if you already have the flight schedules to share, so they can

verify any early check-in, as needed, and also coordinate the transport

HI Cassandra,

Thank you again for the arrangement.

For safety sake, please allow me to counter check if it is possible to

settle the transport payments by credit card, or USD dollars is preferred

(considering it is challenging to exchange cash for BRL and CLP in

Singapore).

Xのプロセス導入を逆説的にSupportする状況かと思います。

///quote///

   \- In wk 17-20, 520units of negative CM are seen in D2 of which most of

   them are from LT.

   \- Many of these were caused by problems with the FY24 LT

   guideline setting.

   \- For the above part, TM will work on improvements (=there should be no

   negative CM on any LT biz).

   \- PSS will be implemented in June. This will eliminate most of D2

   negative CMs.

   \- On the other hand, we will ensure that those low-yield D2 are kept

   within MQC.

   \- TM will continue to monitor D2 usage and its yield transition.

Regret belated, Please find action points for D2 \- TPEB

   \- In wk 17-20, 520units of negative CM are seen in D2 of which most of

   them are from LT.

   \- Many of these were caused by problems with the FY24 LT

   guideline setting.

   \- For the above part, TM will work on improvements (=there should be no

   negative CM on any LT biz).

   \- PSS will be implemented in June. This will eliminate most of D2

   negative CMs.

   \- On the other hand, we will ensure that those low-yield D2 are kept

   within MQC.

   \- TM will continue to monitor D2 usage and its yield transition.

Tks & Rgds,

Ashley

ご共有頂きましてありがとうございます。

田中さんにRaw Dataを少し見せて貰った所、Eagle Xを通していないアカウントがNegative CMをかなり出しているように見受けられました。

Eagle XのPricingツールを使えば、たとえLT MRGが間違えていてもツール内でexpected

CMが確認できますので、この点においてもPricerをサポート出来るかと思われます。

並びに、LT MRGにおいてもFAK同様の改善が必要かと思いますので、引き続き進めて参ります。

Good day Cass, Ryan

Sorry but it is not the same exercise we made three months ago and we have

already discussed all the accounts that will be considered as Eagle X

accounts until March 2025?

The agreed 51 accounts were sent and confirmed again a month ago for the

mentioned cycle.

Adding attached the mail sent to Eagle X team

If this is needed for April 2025 onwards  I think we may propose to add all

the remaining accounts to be handled in Eagle X (if possible to manage) but

don't know if it is very early to talk about them as we don't know how will

be the performance of this peak season with the 300% on increase agains

past year target (17 accounts)

Looking forward for ypur comments prior to work with MKTG team.

Thanks.

Hi Irving,

Allow me to jump on to this wagon.

Previously our focus was on the FY24 Tender season accounts where CKAM

expect to receive tender bids from then till Jul to be added in our target

tender list.

This request from Ryan (My successor) is for FY25 Tender season and we

would like to confirm any changes to the tenders. Well noted based on your

further confirmation today that there are no changes and we can proceed to

use this list for FY25 tender season. In case if there is any new added one

as you are well aware, sometime tender may advance or delay the tender

release date depending on market situation customer so do keep us posted

accordingly 😉

Hi Ryan,

Please proceed to confirm the list of tenders are added into our FY25

Status list (Test and Live), Target Tender account list and invite CST-C to

conduct Preconversion Study for those newly added accounts that we have not

conducted preconversion study yet through @Benhur Dalumpines

\<benhur.dalumpines@one-line.com\>.

Hi Yue Sheng

Thanks for the comment, then yes please consider the previously confirmed

accounts.

As commented in my first mail my vision is to have all 100% accounts added

to Eagle X  (at least those that files allow us to work on it) from April

next year but we need to see which will be the performance result of the

peak season this year especially with the Game Plan and award steps that

are to be added to the process.

We hope by that time all the C-KAMs and MKTG teams will be mature enough in

the Eagle X to work with all the remaining accounts too but I will check

with trade once the peak season ends.

Thank you.

Irving,

Let me intervene.

To avoid your misunderstanding, please note we Eagle X team will focus on

all Long term contract accounts (i.e. above 6 months) for FY24 via Eagle X

based on the guideline from Top management.

Therefore, it's too late to add 100% accounts from April next year. We will

need to handle all the accounts as Eagle X accounts from early bird.

Hi Irving,

Yes, Eagle X Conversion unit will try to conduct pre conversion for all

accounts to confirm if the customer sheet is convertible and capture

necessary information such as potential volume.

Meanwhile, we are collaborating with GCSM to integrate the existing tender

calendar (prepared by GCSM) and status list (prepared by Eagle X) so that

we will be able to see overall Long term accounts in a single file.

Understand GCSM is in the midst of gathering candidates of tender accounts

from respective RHQ and then we (Eagle X/GCSM) will aim to complete the

updated status list by the end June or early July.

For the communication of tender process, believe we can simply refer to

Please let us know in case of any other consideration.

CP: If possible, I would recommend considering the service scopes involved

routes to be quoted by the LAEC Marketing team and vice-versa.

\*LAEC:\* CSW, LAN, LEA, LEE, LEN,

## Fwd: (SYM / GCSM) Eagle X Discussion Summary (20-21 May '24)

受信: Wed May 22 2024 01:25:34 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Koji Nakai \<koji.nakai@one-line.com\>  
道田さん

お疲れさまです。

簡単ですが、以下の通りGCSMのメンバーには昨日、本日で議論した内容を展開致しましたので、ご確認頂ければと存じます。（HKGで一緒に確認しましたので、ここで大きな齟齬は無いはずです）

今週後半か来週月曜日のweeklyでアップデートさせて頂きますが、以下4)の通り、HKG GCSM Tender Management team

(Carmenのチーム)からExecustionの部分をそのままEagle Xにシフトする事に対してはかなり抵抗がありました。

GCSM

(Salesのrepresentative)と言っておきながら、結局はGKAのCKAMの代わりに仕事をしている（TSTのconversionを確認したり、Pricingの内容でトレードにエスカレートしたり等）という感じですが、

自分達の業務でGKAへのオファーに対して高いクオリティが維持できているという自負がかなりあるという印象です。

これはCVAへのAward volumeの入力をCKAMの代わりにHKG

GCSMが行っているというのと同様ですが、GCSMとしてCKAMの仕事を恒久的に行う事が果たして良いのかという事も今後の課題では？と提言しておきました。

Caryと常松さんは、当方の言っている事も理解してくれてる部分はありましたが、実行部隊のCarmenはGKAのCKAMは出来ないからという事だけで思考停止で、あまり響いていない感じでした。

ただ、FY24はoffshore accountにおいてもEagle

Xを通すという事で合意出来ましたので、それは良かった点かと思います。（もちろん、GCSMの意見にも耳を傾けながら、Process /

Toolのenhancementを行う必要はありますが）

今後の進め方につきましてもご相談させて頂きたく、宜しくお願い致します。

Subject: (SYM / GCSM) Eagle X Discussion Summary (20-21 May '24)

To: Cary Low \<cary.low@one-line.com\>, Daisuke Tsunematsu \<

daisuke.tsunematsu@one-line.com\>, Carmen Yau \<carmen.yau@one-line.com\>

Dear Cary / Tsunematsu san / Carmen,

Thank you for your time yesterday and today.

I had a fruitful kick off meeting with you to discuss how to achieve the

ambitious target for FY25 tender from management.

As mentioned, strong collaboration between SYM and GCSM are essential more

than last FY. Let's work together on the precondition that we will use

Eagle X tool / process.

Please find a summary of our discussion at the meeting as per below. In

addition, please see presentation materials \*here\*

\<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ksF8kms4nr5bL\_Cdkxz2xQsJ\_seEL0wo\>.

\* For the remaining such as 1\) Enhancement list and 2\) Processing time data

analysis (incl onshore / offshore), will share shortly.

\*Discussion Points\*

1\) SYM / GCSM agreed that we as ONE will expand our coverage of Eagle X

accounts via Eagle X processes / tools. (Target : All Long / Medium

contract account : approx 1,000 accounts as per GCSM assumption)

    GCSM will support the project and guide Sales / offshore team (TST) to

proceed via Eagle X for FY25 tender. (of course, Eagle X tool / process

enhancement & Pre study are mandatory)

2\) SYM / GCSM agreed to prepare a new Tender list (current : Tender

calendar (GCSM) / Status list (Eagle X)) to capture all necessary

information across the region / account. (Target : complete by end of June)

3\) SYM prefered to clarify current GCSM Tender Management team's task to

confirm whether 1\) there is duplicated task between GCSM and Eagle X team

and 2\) how GCSM are being involved in Tender Execution (Pre-Tender to

Post-Tender). GCSM shared the current task by process but in order for SYM

to clearly understand, SYM requested GCSM to elaborate on what they are

doing by task by taking some examples. (share related files as well)

\*Appreciate if GCSM could quickly assist on this.\*

\[image: image.png\]

4\) SYM proposed to take over some tasks under Tender Execution (at least

Tender stage) so that GCSM can focus on Sales management tasks (Planning,

customer profile etc) which are asked by Trade.

    GCSM expressed some concerns that it would be difficult to 100% hand

over to Eagle X team as HKG GCSM tender management team are working on

behalf of CKAM for GKA.

    Of course, some parts will mitigate current GCSM's task using data

obtained under Eagle X process.

    GCSM counter proposed that we should prioritize expanding coverage for

FY25 Tender without changing the current GCSM task and organization of

offshore teams (CST/TST).

    SYM / GCSM may need more discussion after receipt of above (3) from

GCSM.

5\) Although further discussion on above 4\) could continue, SYM / GCSM

agreed to standardise offshore team's processes by

CST(onshore)/TST(offshore).

    As for the quality of WNS India, GCSM observed that it is at a passing

level though it is not as good as OMMC's quality and proposed that 100%

shift from WNS India to WNS Manila would not be a realistic approach.

6\) GCSM requested SYM to share current enhancement items (Conversion /

Pricing tool respectively) for their clear understanding and visibility.

    GCSM to propose some enhancement requests (e.g. how to correctly export

D\&D into customer sheet in case ONE tariff (Combine) / customer request

(dual DEM/DET) are different etc). SYM to consider enhancing pricing tool.

7\) For Pre-study by TST during off peak season, GCSM prefer to confirm the

entire flow (conversion / pricing (no need to quote) / reverse conversion &

TT input / back to customer sheet) will proceed properly.

    SYM to discuss who prepares the Pricing tool internally. (Eagle X

member in GHQ ? / Set new virtual Eagle X member in EAS ? / Educate GCSM

members how to prep pricing tool for UAT? etc)

\*Next step\*

Eagle X / GCSM will visit OMMC to have discussion with TST/CST to compare

the current process between Eagle X and As-Is and determine the standard

process for FY25 Tender. (proposed date : 5-7 June)

Eagle X / CST will conduct hands-on session for conversion to TST members

(OMMC & WNS India)

Koji Nakai

仲井さん、

ご出張お疲れ様でした。

内容拝承致しました。まぁ、なんとなく初手としては想定通りと言えなくもないですかね。

まさしくご指摘のとおりですが、下記のような仕事をするために、HKGに専門部隊を構えているというのは、費用対効果という面でも、他にもっとやらないといけない点があるという点でもJustifiableではないと思います。

で、次の一手としては、ある程度上の方のAlignmentを取得する必要がありますが、例えばHKGの部隊を2分して、Planningに特化した部隊と、Executionをやる部隊に編成し直して、後者を将来的にはこちらで取り込みつつ、業務の縮小化を図る（最低限の業務に絞り込む）というのはアプローチとしてあるかと思います。

ちょいと、作戦会議をして話をしましょうかね。

コメント頂きましてありがとうございます。

常松さんとのざっくばらんな話では、HKGのExecutionのチームを全てSYM Eagle Xに取り込むのが一番早いだろうという意見をもらいました。

現在の２つのControl towerを1つにして合理化を図った方が、TST/CSTの組織編成だけよりも更に効率よくなるのではという見立てです。

もちろん、これは一筋縄ではいかないでしょうし、時間も要すると思いますので、将来的にはという事になるでしょうが。

また、来週ご相談させて頂ければと存じます。宜しくお願い致します。

Dear Masuda san, Nakai san

CC: Jake, Maeda san, Mr. Hoa

Good day,

Thanks for your request and patience.

As requested, I'd like to share the draft proposal for Eagle X maintenance

project.

\*1) Project Requirement\*

\- Scope of work: Eagle X maintenance

\- Number of headcounts: 4+ FTE (4 DEV+)

\*2) Resource Proposal\*

After considering the project's nature and requirements, we would like to

propose resources with roles as below:

Total additional resources: 6 members \*(5 regular, 1 reserved)(1 BA, 4

Dev., 1 Tester)\*.

Details:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14LfyowatphpHsjTDhyrXFWrUBQqkig-x/edit

The team will have support from a CLV supporter(Mr. Nhien Nguyen, who has

around 6 years of shipping knowledge as leader of the Commercial/Pricing

module in OPUS ITO project).

\*Responsibility of each role\*:

1\. BA: Take responsibility for being a contact point, receiving, analyzing,

and making clear requirements. Ensuring developers understand requirements

correctly and doing final verification development output before delivering

to requesters.

2\. Developer: Take responsibility for developing/implementing based on BA

analysis results.

3\. Tester: Take responsibility for testing the development output from

developers. ensure the product is able to work normally with even

there are any concerns or advice.

Best Regards,

Nam Nguyen

Sorry for the late update.

We discussed with CLV last week and Eagle X PJ would like to start the

Please let us know if there are any procedures that SYM/DYM needs to be

done. (Michida san is aware of this.)

Also, as we informed Neo, we would like to have an on-site kick-off &

intensive Eagle X training session at the CLV office in June (Probably

19-21 June).

Please let us know if you have any concerns.

Thanks & Regards,

Dear Masuda san,

Let me supplement the expense handling process of the workshop in CLV.

Whenever ONE conducts a workshop in CLV, on behalf of ONE's convenience,

CLV pays for lunch boxes, transportation, coffee and 1 ea function dinner

and then reimburses it to OTS later.

In order for OTS to proceed with the payment to CLV, a PA is necessary with

the email confirmation from ONE business owner (expense accountable party).

Let me also explain more details about each expense item:

1\. Hotel booking : Booked by CLV and payment by individual later by ONE

2\. Transportation : ONE can take a grab/taxi individually or choose to rent

a bus, which will be arranged by CLV (payment done by CLV and reimburse to

OTS later)

3\. Lunch boxes/coffee : CLV can arrange lunch boxes for the workshop

participants

4\. Function dinner: ONE usually hosts 1 function dinner per workshop events

(payment can be made by ONE or let CLV pay and reimburse it to OTS later)

If you have any questions, please let me know.

@Hoa Nguyen \<hoa.na@cyberlogitec.com\> If you have any supplements, please

update the above.

Hi Masuda san,

I am sorry I missed the point.

Since the reimbursement is based on the contract between OTS & CLV, the PA

needs to be raised from OTS PIC, which is me.

So, once the estimation of expenses is confirmed by the business owner (in

this case, I assume Masuda san), let me raise a PA and add you to the watch

list.

Dear Jake,

Here is the agenda(still in progress) and flight schedule.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pZI46u9m9z33QWd-DAHacVry7-IGjeCzc5IW02xGJQk/edit\#gid=2129874834

Regarding the expense, I am thinking in red but is it sufficient to raise

PA?

1\. Hotel booking : Booked by CLV and payment by individual later by ONE

→I would like CLV to book a hotel and we will pay individually

2\. Transportation : ONE can take a grab/taxi individually or choose to rent

a bus, which will be arranged by CLV (payment done by CLV and reimburse to

OTS later)

→We will take a grab/taxi so no need to arrange by CLT.

3\. Lunch boxes/coffee : CLV can arrange lunch boxes for the workshop

participants

→Appreciate CLT would arrange it.

4\. Function dinner: ONE usually hosts 1 function dinner per workshop events

(payment can be made by ONE or let CLV pay and reimburse it to OTS later)

→Appreciate CLV book a place and we (DYM) will pay for it there.

Thanks & Regards,

Kazuki Masuda

Hi Benhur san

Additional to Minebea Mitsumi and Uniqlo, below are the target accounts

which will be received earlier than Nov.

However, considering the validity, they are all FY25 Tenders. I will check

the validity for Uniqlo, but maybe FY25 Tender i/o FY24.

For Minebea Mitsumi, Pre-Conversion is already done in 20240101-202410630

(1H) Tender, so can we think that 2H Seq No. will be added to the Live

Confirmed with Uniqlo sales that the validity will be 20240901 \- 20250830\.

Considering this validity, it would be FY25 Tender rather than FY24.

For the potential tenders for May and June, there aren't new accounts, but

"HALF YEAR" tender will be in scope for FY24. 1 account will be Minebea

Mitsumi.

Pls kindly sort the "HALF YEAR" tender which was done through Eagle-X and

add in LIVE status if any.

Dear Masuda san, Benhur san

As per our discussion, only "HALF YEAR" tender which was done through

Eagle-X should be in scope for FY24 coming tender.

However, WOOD ONE, SUMITOMO RUBBER, TOYO TIRE and UNIQLO which we think of

as FY25 Tenders are listed in the Eagle X target account list.

Can we think that this Eagle X target account list is listing both FY24 and

FY25 accounts?

## Eagle X Touchpoint \- Follow Up

受信: Mon Apr 08 2024 15:48:00 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Giselle Lopes \<giselle.lopes@one-line.com\>  
Hello Koji and Kazuki-San

Hope you are well.

I wanted to touch base on a few points to ensure we're aligned moving

forward:

1\. EUA Eagle X Game Plan Summary: Training Sessions \- KOJI:\* "set to take

place sometime in June". \*

   \- Could you please send more details on when, how and who will carry out

   the training.

   \- Also, for my reference I'd like to know who are the Eagle X team

   members directly involved in this section of the Project so I can reach

   out to them if any issues arise.

As you know, we decided to postpone the rollout of Eagle X to the EUA

region due to the timing being late in the tender season.

To ensure a smooth transition, I'd like to reach out to EUA Sales in

advance of any training announcements. This will give them some time to

prepare for the upcoming changes and be more receptive when training is

announced. My aim is to email them on the 15th of April, let me know if you

will have dates set by then.

Kind Regards,

\*Giselle Lopes\*

Hi Giselle,

Apologies for belated.

Please find my comments below in blue.

Could you please send more details on when, how and who will carry out the

training.

(KN) GCSM Tender Management team in HKG will take a lead in conducting

rollout sessions to Sales and Eagle X team will support on how to use the

tool for Game Plan Summary Sheet.

         Although our idea is that the rollout session (via VC or F2F)

needs to take place in June or July, we will need to make an alignment with

GCSM. Believe they don't have an objection to that.

Also, for my reference I'd like to know who are the Eagle X team members

directly involved in this section of the Project so I can reach out to them

if any issues arise.

(KN) Game Plan unit in Eagle X team is as follows.

         @Flourance Tan \<flourance.tan@one-line.com\>, @Thipthida

Visetruangrote \<Thipthida.Visetruangrote@one-line.com\>, @Ying En Lim

\<yingen.lim@one-line.com\>,  @Mabel Lee \<mabel.lee@one-line.com\>

         Since they are my team members, will follow up if any issue.

Best regards,

日本での打ち合わせ中に少し話しがでましたが、人を追加し開発を前倒しで進める件もご相談できればと思います。

   \- 5ページ

      \- Account当たりの作業時間(左上のグラフ)を土日を抜いた時間の数字にUpdate

      \- Eagle X Accountを165 → 169にUpdate(Dashboardの数字と合わせることができませんでした。)

   \- 6ページ

   \- 21ページ

      \- JPの数を見直し。1,273 → 1,049(会議中に口頭で説明させていただきましたが、集計の仕方に誤りがあったためです。)

      \- 上記に伴い、合計も変更。2,041 → 1,817件。(7ページの目標は、2,000社のままとしています。)

      \- JPのLane数の集計とその割合の説明を追加。7,767Laneで、36%。

      \- JPのNVO/BCO別に分析した会社数/Lane数のファイルとなります。リンク：

Nakai san & Masuda san,

We encountered some issues when we tried to upload the file onto ONE

Force.  Would you review the following points?

1\. The template matches CVA template except "CGM POR Country Name" that is

not required in CVA template. Would you advise us what is the purpose of

this column separated from "Origin Country Name" ?

2\. Some fields are missing SC/RFA number.  Can you please check with ONE

Japan?

3\. Wrong SC/RFA number (that does not match with the validity)  Can you

please check with ONE Japan?

4\. CKAM has not been registered in ONEForce SSTM causing an error message

"CKAM is not mapped under SSTM.  As we cannot proceed with CVA upload

without CKAM info, can you request Japan to register CKAM in ONE Force

correctly?    (\*SSTM is a module in ONE Force for registering sales person

per sales role)

 \* DENSO : sales registered as GAM but not yet registered as CKAM

 \* MINEBEAMIITUSIMI INC : missing SSTM registration

 \* Toyota Industries : data was fine

Many thanks for checking and valuable comments.

Since this is the first case to conduct upload in CVA  instead of

respective JPN sales, there were some unexpected issues for us.

As for some points you raised, please find my comments below\* in blue\*.

Would like to update.

For 1, please note we have deleted “Origin Country Name” so you won’t see

that in future.

For 4, I have asked ONEJ to address the issue.

Will wait for your feedback on 2 & 3\.

Tsunematsu san,

As for Point 4, please note ONEJ has updated SSTM of the following

customers.

As a result, the CVA and SSTM C-KAMs should match.

// quote //

 \* DENSO : sales registered as GAM but not yet registered as CKAM

 \* MINEBEAMIITUSIMI INC : missing SSTM registration

// unquote //

Meanwhile, I received the below question from ONEJ

In the case of OneCare, they should have been able to register CVA even if

they did not assign a C-KAM in SSTM.

They would like to confirm whether there were some errors through uploading

those 3 accounts in CVA. Please advise.

Nakai san & Masuda san,

 cc Imai san,

Thank you for your time last Friday.

1\) Regarding your query of the zero award lanes, ONE Force accepts zero

CVA  "with SSG+Domi Flag level (no need to country/port-pair level) &

without Revenue Lane Code". In other words, sales can create zero CVA in

SSG+Domi Flag level granularity at least so that they can identify lost

business in CVA.  Zero CVA can also be created in portpair level without

Revenue Lane Code too, although the data granularity is not mandatory.

That means, ONE Japan can either upload zero CVA in SSG+Domi Flag

granularity or in Portpair level granularity depending on their preference.

They must ensure all the SSG+Domi Flag are covered with zero CVA if all

lost lanes are filed in OPUS (otherwise, OF will show "Incomplete" in CVA

completion status because OF look at existence of SC/RFA in Service Scope

Code level to monitor CVA completion status vs Opus).

\[image: image.png\]

2\) Regarding award data for Denso, we suspect some data provided by ONE

Japan should be incorrect. (For example, Denso SC\#"NGO004B23")   Shall GCSM

upload the file onto CVA first and ONE Japan sales directly review it to

correct the data in ONE Force by themselves?  Or do they prefer to correct

the data in the file by themselves before GCSM upload it in ONEForce?

While GCSM would upload the initial batch of Japan's award data on their

behalf for trial purpose, as discussed for the future process, GCSM

strongly recommends ONE Japan directly upload award data after they

received converted award data from Eagle X team, which would help to avoid

such inefficient back-and-forth communication among Japan\<\>SYM\<\>GCSM,

especially when irregular data was found like this case.

3\) Regarding the draft message of sales guidance of the new workflow of CVA

for Initial AP

\<https://docs.google.com/document/d/13uF\_s56TZQrj3TggStICDVD09e3L3sBA-Q8rjMGvp54/edit\>,

thank you for your confirmation on our draft.  As discussed separately, I

understand that TP-Domi and AE-Domi are excluded from the scheme this year.

We reflect it in the guidance as follows.

## Re: \[Eagle X \- LIVE\] \[Eagle X\_LIVE\] CVA Upload Request to GCSM\_2024-03-27 ver01\_04

受信: Tue Apr 09 2024 19:02:38 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Koji Nakai \<koji.nakai@one-line.com\>  
Tsunematsu san,

Thank you for your feedback.

As for 1\) & 2), duly noted the condition on what info Sales need to input

in case of zero CVA.

Since we Eagle X team converted nomination volume into CVA template by port

pair, ONE will take port pair level granularity.

Appreciate if you could assist to conduct mass upload using the link below.

SC\# for Denso has been updated properly.

(1st batch)

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tl4cfnV84IAzSZ9ecZ8xA1xjARKRVY\_cMCp72tHxJ-0/edit\#gid=1540186983

(2nd batch)

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q59gUbiNQ5SvM0qZSjJyG1JzvVrFGQ96pmlo761WQ4E/edit\#gid=1540186983

Meanwhile, I have proposed JP SYM as to who will be appropriate department

(PIC) to conduct mass upload.

I totally support your opinion. Ideally, JP Sales should do by

themselves once they receive the CVA template prepared by Eagle X team

while that was the original idea.

Nevertheless, if JP Sales don't do that, either JP SYM or Eagle X team will

need to do it instead.

Before we conclude, would like to see whether there are any errors on mass

upload for the above 1st / 2nd batch.

In case of lots of errors, it might be hard for CST to do that.

Best regards,

Koji Nakai

Please find below findings and suggestions for the 1st batch and 2nd batch

CVA upload.

You can refer to attached files in which we have added two columns showing

whether CVA uploaded (Y/N) under Column-AC.  If "N", please refer to

'Remarks' under Column-AD (to see ONE Force error message)

Suggestions for improvement :

1\) Sales should ensure the registration in SSTM in ONE Force is complete

prior to their requests for upload.  Upload failed due to not yet C-KAM

approved in SSTM

2\) Suggest SYM/DYM double check the logic for populating revenu lane code.

We find some incorrect revenue lane code

\*1st Batch (total 354 records from 3 a/cs)\*

ご対応頂きましてありがとうございます。

Mitsui Sokoは、昨日安斎さんの方でCVAへupload済、残りはMITSUBISHI Corpだけと理解しました。

お手数ですが、そのままCVAへmass uploadして頂くことは可能でしょうか。

GCSMからは1st/2nd batchのトライアルはサポートしてくれたものの、何度もmass

uploadする作業は避けたいとの事。（またerrorが出るかも知れないので）

この点は私も同感でして、GCSMにuploadをお願いする必要も無く、JP Salesが自身でuploadしないのならば、JP SYM-Eagle X

team間で完結できるかなと思っています。（もちろん accountabilityはJP Salesの前提です）

あいにくCSTにはCVAにアップロードする権限がまだありませんので、お願いさせて頂いている次第です。

Tsunematsu san,

(cc Sundar)

Many thanks for your assistance on mass upload and checking.

We got feedback from JP SYM in red. Please find it and provide feedback on

4\. Toshiba Tec.

Meanwhile, considering possible errors in future, I am asking JP SYM to

upload the remaining data with errors into CVA by themselves.

If they don't accept, Eagle X tema will need to conduct mass upload instead

while that is not my intention.

In such a case, we may need to ask Sundar to give CST (offshore members) an

authority to upload CVA templates.Will keep you posted.

Best regards,

Dear Irving,

Duly noted below with thanks.   We will proceed to ADD those accounts into

the LIVE Tender Status as preparation for the actual tender.

By the way, just wanna confirm.  We have 2 March target accounts which we

have not processed yet.

\[image: image.png\]

May we know if those tenders are already released separately outside Eagle

X, or we're still waiting for the actual tender?

Good day Benhur

Regarding your question please consider that Industrial Minera will not

release a tender for this cycle so we don't need to keep waiting.

Regarding Codelco I have in the tender that this will be released in

November not in March and for 2023 tender CL MKTG requested not to work the

account in Eagle X as they were just receiving the training.

Thank you

Hello all,

Allow me to jump in.

Dear @Benhur Dalumpines \<benhur.dalumpines@one-line.com\>\* / EagleX team\*:

Please, confirm when you should send the Route Portfolio Simulation for the

LATAM tenders released in May?

Marketing and Sales are already late to discuss the pre-tender stage for

these ones, meaning that the initial process through EagleX might be

jeopardized.

Please, also advise when you should release the remaining Portfolio Sim.

files for the LATAM target accounts in 2024 (per the list previously shared

by Irving), by prioritizing the accounts with the nearest release month,

i.e. May, June, and so on.

Thanks.

Best Regards,

Dear @Benhur Dalumpines \<benhur.dalumpines@one-line.com\>\* / EagleX team\*:

Please, confirm when you should send the Route Portfolio Simulation for the

LATAM tenders released in May?

Marketing and Sales are already late to discuss the pre-tender stage for

these ones, meaning that the initial process through EagleX might be

jeopardized.

Please, also advise when you should release the remaining Portfolio Sim.

files for the LATAM target accounts in 2024 (per the list previously shared

by Irving), by prioritizing the accounts with the nearest release month,

i.e. May, June, and so on.

Thanks.

Regarding your question please consider that Industrial Minera will not

release a tender for this cycle so we don't need to keep waiting.

Regarding Codelco I have in the tender that this will be released in

November not in March and for 2023 tender CL MKTG requested not to work the

account in Eagle X as they were just receiving the training.

Thank you

Duly noted below with thanks.   We will proceed to ADD those accounts into

the LIVE Tender Status as preparation for the actual tender.

By the way, just wanna confirm.  We have 2 March target accounts which we

have not processed yet.

May we know if those tenders are already released separately outside Eagle

X, or we're still waiting for the actual tender?

## Eagle X Target candidates \- April/2024 List

受信: Tue Mar 19 2024 21:20:17 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Giselle Lopes \<giselle.lopes@one-line.com\>  
Dear All

I hope you are all well.

I'd like to reiterate that the Eagle X Pricing Tool is our primary platform

for tender processing. Effective January 2024, all Onshore tenders must be

submitted through Eagle X.

Key Points:

   \- Pre-Selected Onshore Tenders: the Eagle X team releases and updates a

   Eagle X Target List for onshore tenders, refer to the link below.

   \- \*Action Required for Pre-Selected Tenders:\*

      \- \*Do not release tenders to TRADE teams\* for pricing through the old

      system

      \- Complete all pre-tender procedures (T\&Cs analysis, Bunker Clause

      approval, BP analysis, Game Plan) as usual.

      \- Upload tender files to the designated Eagle X Live Folder

      (instructions available in the EAGLE X Portal

      \<https://sites.google.com/one-line.com/eaglex/training/salestst-training-zone?authuser=0\>

      ).

      \- If one of your tenders were selected and for any reason you believe

      it should not be included in Eagle please reach out to me for assistance.

This is a kind reminder for the targeted tenders going \*LIVE on EAGLE X in

April/2024.\*

\<https://sites.google.com/one-line.com/eaglex/training/salestst-training-zone?authuser=0\>.

Should you need assistance with the tool or if you have any questions,

please don't hesitate to reach out to the Eagle X Team.

tenders via Eagle X be it via onshore/offshore/both processes to provide

their honest feedback via the Eagle X Sales Survey Form.

## \[Eagle X \- Live\] T\&C summary process enhancement

受信: Sat Feb 24 2024 00:02:02 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Kasia Stannard \<kasia.stannard@one-line.com\>  
\*\*\*Removed Trade\*\*\*

Hi Koji & GHQ Eagle X colleagues,

Have you made any progress on the suggestion below from Wayne on including

T\&C summary/rate structure details table similar to offshore

tenders handled by IN/OMMC Tender?

I think it's a very good idea as it would add a nice summary of main T\&C

plus be something that Pricers are already familiar with but of course we

need to avoid duplicated input form C-KAM & ensure it fits in your side of

the process of conversion ect.

Thank you.

Best regards,

## Re: \[Eagle X \- Live\] T\&C summary process enhancement

受信: Mon Feb 26 2024 08:00:00 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Koji Nakai \<koji.nakai@one-line.com\>  
Hi Kasia,

We are still under discussion on this matter.

Unlike TST who support offshore tenders, CST(Conversion Support Team) don't

prepare T\&C summary/rate structure details as their responsibility is to

convert to ONE format & reverse convert to customer sheet properly.

Instead of that, Sales input the above info into the check-list whenever

they want.

If EUA strongly request to change the process as per Wayne's proposal, of

course we can consider that while other regions except JPN are still fine

with the current process for onshore tenders.

In order to proceed, we will need to make sure of the below.

Once we change the process for onshore tenders, we will prepare the same

template as offshore tenders for Sales to input T\&C summary/rate structure

details etc as Sales intention sheet.

Instead of that, inputting the details in the current check-list must be

avoided.

Can you please advise whether the above is workable for EUA sales? FYR,

only JPN sales is already preparing such a summary.

Appreciate your assistance.

Best regards,

Koji Nakai

Hi Koji,

Please let me check if I understood you correctly \- we can replace Initial

Check-In google form with the same template as for offshore tenders for

Sales to input T\&C summary/rate structure details etc as Sales intention

sheet, is that correct?

I believe it would simplify the process greatly for both Sales & Pricers

but let me also invite \*RHQ Sales (RIC)\* comments.

What about Conversion Checklist & Review/TT Input \- I am assuming it will

stay as it is?

## Re: \[Eagle X \- Live\] T\&C summary process enhancement

受信: Fri Mar 01 2024 23:23:49 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Adam Hedges \<adam.hedges@one-line.com\>  
Hello all, can I confirm if we are talking Commercial T\&C's therefore

Pricing, covering elements such as Free Time, BAF and rate structure or are

we talking Contractual T\&C's such as Risk, Order of Precedence and P\&I

Cover?

If Commercial then this aspect is the domain of the Pricers within M\&C

Teams.  If Contractual then that is myself and EUA Legal.

Apologies if it's clear in the missive but I am somewhat behind so, have

scanned this briefly and the above is the first question that came to mind.

Kind Regards

Adam

Hi Adam,

We are talking about commercial T\&C as per example in the email below:

\[image: image.png\]

The reason why we need the RHQ Sales view is that it may impact the Sales

part of Eagle X to extend & it's linked to the feedback provided by Giselle

on Sales finding Eagle X rate structure part complicated.

Thank you.

Commercial T\&C's are not our domain but down to Sales to Correctly

communicate with the Pricing team.  Of course if Giselle has spotted some

aspect then I'll leave her to comment but my element of T\&C's are aspects

like Service Level Agreements and  Risk beyond ONE Bill of Lading which

will remain outside of the Eagle X process.

Giselle, feel free to comment further on your observations.  I'll leave you

to lead here for EUA Sales Support.

Dear Flourance, Masuda, and Eagle X team,

As you may know, we're planning to deliver another Eagle X training session

to the countries that didn't participate last year.

Please could you help us create an example on Eagle X test environment so

we can use that on the training? Also, a route portfolio simulation for the

presentation.

The suggested tender to use as below.

Hi Gabriel,

Thank you for LARHQ initiative to expand EagleX scope and training to other

countries.

We have included Frigol in Test Status List for your training purposes.

For Route Portfolio Simulation, we would like to counter check the intended

period for simulation.

This contract is effective from Jan 2024, with only Jan lifting result is

completed / available at this moment. Shall we use Jan-Dec 2023 for the

simulation?

Taking this opportunity, shall we consider Game Plan Summary rollout /

training to Sales too?

Good day Flourance.

For now only Route portfolio and pricing tools will be on the training.

This is because the participants will be from the remaining countries and

Gameplan training needs to be given to all the countries.

Depending on GCSM advances on Gameplan we will  prepare a future training

for that part only for all countries at the same time.

Thank you

Hi Gabriel,

Thanks for the initiative of the training sessions to Sales.

In the view of Pre-Conversion, Conversion and Consolidation Process, we

would like to know if the training agenda and materials will cover the

items below:

1\) Will the Demo cover all process Initial check in, Conversion Checklist,

Sales Review and Input TT

\- We suggest to create "Test Account" (Link

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13JBWJdqp\_CsF387zpq3UbAJ3LceVjSK7eEyaIaRUPjQ/edit\#gid=401683546\>)

instead of actual customer account in the Test Status List

\- If Sales Review and Input TT is required to be covered, we will need some

time to prepare conversion tool so that you can go through the steps.

2\) Will participants do the "exercises" during or after the training?

\- if so, we suggest to create a series of test accounts for them along with

Training Exercises Record Sheet

This is the sample EAS & SAS Sales 1st Unlock Registration Form

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/179xGRb81LUfghYUjF8mVbZg3pgy-9KIJ8wgznRBghvQ/edit\#gid=1459674339\>

Hi Sharon,

Sorry for the late reply. Find in red my comments.

1\) Will the Demo cover all process Initial check in, Conversion Checklist,

Sales Review and Input TT

\- We suggest to create "Test Account" (Link

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13JBWJdqp\_CsF387zpq3UbAJ3LceVjSK7eEyaIaRUPjQ/edit\#gid=401683546\>)

instead of actual customer account in the Test Status List

\- If Sales Review and Input TT is required to be covered, we will need some

time to prepare conversion tool so that you can go through the steps.

GW. We wish to use the same scenario as the real tender, so all the

training files will be based on that. We just need the same files created

in the test environment.

So once they fill up the Initial check in per example, we will already have

the check list in the folder to show to them, then there is no need for the

offshore to do anything once we already have all the files there.

2\) Will participants do the "exercises" during or after the training?

\- if so, we suggest to create a series of test accounts for them along with

Training Exercises Record Sheet

This is the sample EAS & SAS Sales 1st Unlock Registration Form

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/179xGRb81LUfghYUjF8mVbZg3pgy-9KIJ8wgznRBghvQ/edit\#gid=1459674339\>

GW. The same as the answer above.

3\) Any Training Material Support?

This is the sample  EAGLE X Refresher Training Session to EAS/SAS 10 Jan 24

\<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1F5o8V3dzq-\_PpP3d7o4swBBRZ5TMGZ6aQJWWTSQ7Nds/edit?usp=drive\_link\>

GW. We already have the one used on the training session for BR, CL and MX.

But thank you for the material.

4\) Any survey regarding the training content and quality will be delivered

to participants?

## Re: Eagle X training preparation

受信: Tue Apr 02 2024 19:41:45 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Sharon Tang \<sharon.tang@one-line.com\>  
Dear Gabriel,

Thanks for your comments. Please see my comments below in Blue.

1\) Will the Demo cover all process Initial check in, Conversion Checklist,

Sales Review and Input TT

\- We suggest to create "Test Account" (Link

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13JBWJdqp\_CsF387zpq3UbAJ3LceVjSK7eEyaIaRUPjQ/edit\#gid=401683546\>)

instead of actual customer account in the Test Status List

GW. We wish to use the same scenario as the real tender, so all the

training files will be based on that. We just need the same files created

in the test environment.

So once they fill up the Initial check in per example, we will already have

the check list in the folder to show to them, then there is no need for the

offshore to do anything once we already have all the files there.

ST: CST will do pre-conversion study for the tenders and the conversion

result will be recorded in the Test Status List. To avoid confusion, you

and trainees can apply the G-BR654321 as the Group Customer Code and each

trainer and trainee can be assigned to individual sequence number (e.g Seq

1, Seq 2....). We will indicate the email address under "Reason for

dividing Sequence No".

Under this practice, every trainee can do revision anytime during/after the

training session by using the respective sequence number to get familiar

with the Process.

\[image: image.png\]

\- If Sales Review and Input TT is required to be covered, we will need some

time to prepare conversion tool so that you can go through the steps.

ST: In actual scenario, CST need to do conversion process and send back to

Sales for review the location mapping, surcharge setting and TT Input.

Therefore, if you wish Trainees to do this review process, Eagle X GHQ

Conversion Unit will prepare ahead for the "completed" conversion via

conversion tool and Trainees can do the review during the training. It will

take some time to do preparation before the training session. Please let us

know if you would like to demostrate this process and wish Trainee to do

this process review.

2\) Will participants do the "exercises" during or after the training?

\- if so, we suggest to create a series of test accounts for them along with

Training Exercises Record Sheet

This is the sample EAS & SAS Sales 1st Unlock Registration Form

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/179xGRb81LUfghYUjF8mVbZg3pgy-9KIJ8wgznRBghvQ/edit\#gid=1459674339\>

GW. The same as the answer above.

ST: We suggest to use the above record sheet to indicate the trainers and

trainees account information clearly.

3\) Any Training Material Support?

This is the sample  EAGLE X Refresher Training Session to EAS/SAS 10 Jan 24

\<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1F5o8V3dzq-\_PpP3d7o4swBBRZ5TMGZ6aQJWWTSQ7Nds/edit?usp=drive\_link\>

GW. We already have the one used on the training session for BR, CL and MX.

But thank you for the material.

ST: You're welcome.

4\) Any survey regarding the training content and quality will be delivered

to participants?

This is the sample  EAGLE X: EAS & SAS SALES TRAINING

\<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd9lifznpXYoY\_jjfdxSTsEeUDksZ9UmRkT8s69jIgnkUNWpw/viewform\>

GW. Thank you, I will discuss this point with Irving in the coming weeks.

ST: Let us know if you need any assistant/support from our end.

Thanks again for the continued support with Eagle X and the initiatives

with LA Sales. 😉

Please allow me to comment on behalf of Leandro.

Considering this is NA E2E Test, we should send the Pricing Request to only

However at the same time, we would like to show them how the Pricing

Therefore can you manually adjust and send to only NA MKTG whilst keeping

the content? Thank you.

## Eagle X関連ツールのインプリに関するGCSM方針の目線合わせ

受信: Fri Feb 09 2024 09:17:45 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Daisuke Tsunematsu \<daisuke.tsunematsu@one-line.com\>  
仲井さん、

NAにおけるGame Plan Summaryのインプリに関し、

本日NAセールスへの第一弾ロールアウトセッションを調整中でしたが、NAM側とスケジュールの折り合わず再調整致します。

SYMよりMabelにご出席いただけると伺っていますが、仲井さんかFlouranceのご出席も是非お願いできたらと考えています。

ところで今期のGPSのインプリはテンダーピークシーズンの最中になってしまったこともあり、

NAMを除いては多くのケースでGame Planは完了済、そのため今期のインプリはNAMに

フォーカスすることはこれまでSYM/GCSM間で話してきた通りです。

GPSについては概要や方向性についてNAMマネジメントより合意を得ているものの、

Live環境での実戦経験もまだありませんので、今期のインプリはあくまで来期以降の本格稼働に向けたパイロットランの位置づけだと考えています。

GPS然り、Eagle Xや、またこれからロールアウト予定のAward Managementでも同様だと思いますが、

Live環境下でのユーザーの使用感であったり、実践的なプロセスでの滑った転んだを通じて課題や改善点が見つかり、

今期に直面した課題への対処の積み重ねが、真に来期以降のインプリやUser Adoptionの成否を決めることになるのだろうと想像しています。

GCSMはGHQ M\&Cの一員としてこれまで通りインプリをサポートさせていただく方針に変わりありませんが、一方でSales

Userの代弁者でもありますので、

SYM/DYMに対してSales Adoptionをコミットする立場というよりは、Sales Adoptionの向上に向けて、

セールス目線或いはテンダーマネジメントの目線で、プロセスの課題や改善策を提起する形でインプリに貢献していく方針であることはこれまで通りです。

引き続きよろしくお願い致します。

常松さん

NAへのGame Plan Summaryのrolloutにつきまして現状承知しました。

日時が決定しましたら、Flouranceにも出席してもらうように伝えておきます。

他RHQへのrolloutですが、対象アカウント数も少ないことから、大々的にrolloutするのを躊躇われているのは理解しています。

したがいまして、FY24はこんな感じでGame Planを行うという事を理解してもらえば良いのかなと思っております。

GHQ SYMからはGHQ/RHQのトレードにはロールアウトは致しましたので、対象アカウントのC-KAMに絞ってご説明されてはいかがでしょうか。

Tradeとしてもどんな感じでGame Planを受領するのか経験したいはずですので。

また、Awardやその他のロールアウトに向けてのGCSMの立場についても承知しました。

Salesの代弁者というのはもちろん理解しておりますし、SYM/DYMとなるとTrade目線で考えがちなので、頂くコメントは非常に貴重です。

一方で、プロジェクトを前に進めるためには、全てのリクエストに応えることが難しい場合もありますので、この点についてはご理解頂かなければいけない部分もあるかと思います。

昨年4月から本プロジェクトに参加し、個人的に感じている事ですが、SYM/DYM-GCSMとの関わり方がまだしっくりしないのが正直なところです。

現在のGCSMの組織自体に疑問を感じており、onshore /

offshoreという枠組みなど(offshoreだけ対応するTSTも尚更）無くしたほうがすっきりするのではと思います。

これは栗本さんはじめ上の皆さんが決められることですが、少なくとも来期以降に向けて、両者間の関わり方についてもう少しお話できればと考えています。

お互いだと思いますが、Local memberの声を聞いていると、決して良い関係性のようには思えませんので。

まずは足元のAward processにおいて、昨年よりもsalsの負荷が少しでも減るように、今井さんはじめEagle

Xメンバーで対応しておりますので、来週以降でお話させて頂ければと思います。

引き続き宜しくお願いします。

仲井

仲井さん、

新年快楽！

NAM以外のRegionについて、今期は対象のC-KAMに絞ってロールアウトする計画ではありますが、

時期的なことを考えると、はたしてGame Planのためにいま新プロセスを導入することが適切なのか逡巡する思いもありまして、

いずれにしてもまずはNAMでのインプリに重きを置きたい考えです。

SYMとGCSMの関係性について、私も着任以来苦慮し続けていますが、

双方に相応の言い分があると申しますか、それぞれにアジェンダが異なるが故という風に理解しています。

GCSM Tender Managementの目標はあくまでテンダーの円滑な執行ですので、

その立ち位置からEagle Xに関与するようにとマネジメントから指示を受けています。

ローカルメンバーは時に感情的になりすぎて時々ご迷惑をお掛けしていますが、

GCSMはGHQ M\&Cの一員としてEagle Xのインプリの一翼を担っていることをことあるごとに申し伝えており、

実際に、たとえばUATやインプリ計画の議論等でもかなりのワークロードを割いて協力させていただいています。

オフショアテンダーのプロセスは、まさにTender Managementのビジネスバリューの一環ですが、

Eagle Xの目線では、もしかするとプロセスのスタンダード化の障壁のように映っているかも知れません。

CSTとTSTで目的と専門性が違うので、役割をどのように整理するかが鍵になると考えています。

来期以降の関わり方やプロセスの方向性について、ぜひお話させてください。

また今期Award Management Processの件、引き続きよろしくお願い致します。

常松さん

新年快楽！

香港は1日シンガポールよりもお休みが長いのですね。

今週から引き続き宜しくお願い致します。

Game Planにつきましては、NAに重きを置き、それ以外のRegionはどう進めるか検討中との事、承知致しました。

TradeにはRollout済みですので、仮にNA以外のRegioにおいては今期はGPSを行わないとなれば、RHQ Sales

Managementと連携の上、Tradeにも共有頂ければと思います。

GCSM/SYMの今後の連携については、テンダーが落ち着くであろう4月以降にお話させてください。

同じM\&Cで非常に近い業務を行っているので、お互いに同じ方向を向いて進めていけたらと思いますので。

まずは目先のAward Processのアップデートですが、今週のどこかでSYM/DYMよりさせて頂ければと思います。

とは言うものの、私事で恐縮ですが、明日、明後日とお休みを頂く予定でして…今井さん、増田さんの方からアップデート頂ければと思います。（お二人、すみませんがご対応の方、宜しくお願い致します）

先行で常松さんにはお伝えしておきますと、GHQ Tradeとも議論を重ね、彼らの意向は先日お伝えしたプロセス(sign offの為にRoute

Portfolio SImulation (RPS) sheet or Non RPS sheet いづれかにNomination

volumeを入力)で進めたいとの事です。

そうする事でsign

offの標準化（あるトレードは別templateでSalesに入力依頼等の廃止）且つSalesとしてはこの時点で入力するアカウントにおいてはCVAの入力作業を無くすことが可能となります。（一部のTradeはInitial

APも自動で進める事が可）

懸念されている、sign off前のSalesによる入力作業（時間）についてですが、Non-RPS(以下)については一つのシートにGame

Plan対象外のTrade全てを入力し、粒度も以下の通りですので、それほど大変な作業では無いかと思料致します。

SYM/DYMとしましては今期のAwardは時間も無い為（Go

Live対応でギリギリになってしまい、すみません）、上記のプロセスで進められればと考えております。

宜しくお願い致します。

仲井さん、

Award Managementのアイディアについてご連絡ありがとうございます。

Sign Offの段階でテンプレートに入力するのが合理的だという点は同意見なのですが、

営業にとって実行可能かどうかは別次元の話ですので、この点はRegion経由で話を聞いてコンセンサスをとる必要があるかなと感じています。

GCSMへのブリーフィングの件よろしくお願いします。

(CC Michael / Elton)

As per our discussion last week, we Eagle X team would like to share an

attached TPEB pricing tool mock-up for Eagle X (please download it in your

laptop first) and hear your thoughts after you play with that.

Compared to existing Eagle X pricing which other Trades are using, most of

the functions have been removed.

Having said that, we would like to maintain the below functions at least to

standardise Eagle X process across the board.

As quickly demonstrated last weekly, let us introduce the respective

function.

\*(Macro button added in the current TPEB Pricing tool V34)\*

\[image: image.png\]

   1\. \*Import\* : Incorporate data (ONE Format) converted from customer

   sheet into the Pricing tool

                  \*Since Eagle X team will share the pricing tool with NA

   Mktg after incorporating data, NA Mktg will not use the button. (let us

   leave it for our operation)

   2\. \*Refresh E2E Routes\* : Retrieve routes based on a combination of

   POR/POL/POD/DEL/Cargo TYpe/Trunk service which apply current TPEB Pricing

   tool logic

   3\. \*Export \*: Offer by Pricer to be exported into customer sheet

   4\. \*Submit \*: Once Export is done, submit Pricer's offer and

   automatically notify CST(offshore) and Sales by email

   5\. \*Add Rounds \*: In case there are R4 and R5, automatically add same

   columns as R1-R3 in the tool

\*(Additional columns)\*

\*  Column AA \- AD\*   : Customer's request rate structure

\*  Column AF \- AN\*   : Customer Remarks

\*  Column DS \*: End to End Route Summary based on Trunk service under NA

Mktg logic

\*  Column DT \- DV  \*: Decline offer / reason etc

\*  Column DX \- EE  \*: Cost based on End to End Route Summary and expected

CM

Other than the above, we won't touch anything from the current NA in-house

pricing tool so believe the above function and information would be

beneficial for you.

Having said that, there might still be unnecessary information for your

trade such as Customer's request rate structure (Column AA \- AD). If

affirmative, please let us know.

Please note that the pricing operation itself won't change at all.

For example, Column N : Via / Column BB : Dest. CY Hub are very important

for pricing, hence we won't touch those columns.

As per current operation, please manually input information in Column N &

Column BB and then click the "Refresh E2E Routes" button.

By doing so, you will be able to see E2E routes, cost and expected CM

information.

Currently once retrieved E2E routes, all the P1-P3 routing can be seen.

If the information is too much, we can consider picking routes only you

would prefer.

Of course, data retrieving time is still challenging so we will check how

long it will take using other accounts who have more port pairs.

Identifying E2E routes would be beneficial from TT input perspective so

hopefully you will accept this function even if it takes time a bit.

Appreciate if you provide us feedback by 6 Dec (Wed) so that we can enhance

the tool by sign off timing (mid of Dec).

Should you have any questions, please reach out to us.

Best regards,

Koji Nakai

Nakai san and Masuda san,

We have further reviewed those 2 key elements you have modified

recently(Pricing Tool & G-form input) and have some comments on those.

Please find the summary Here

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VbaBYTL0O1bn5iaFRRFc8UiSvE\_jRAHSHa7zi18HAbw/edit\#gid=578739740\>

.

Generally both items(Pricing tool & G-form) are revised in a very

positive way based on our conversation. Thank you very much for the

modification.

On the other hand, we still see some unclear points like those newly added

features under the Pricing Tool as well as overall flow between

stakeholders. We believe those can be clarified once we have a mock up

session.

We also added some additional requests about the G-form structure which is

coming from an overall process flow standpoint, we'd need to reconfirm step

by step flow once again to make sure there's no hole in the general process

flow.

Based on the above general comments as well as the feedback we summarized

in the link,

we at this point think the whole process still needs some brushing up,

meaning we need some trials to make sure A\~Z all work fine before we roll

this out.

And furthermore, as we have already entered the tender season(Eagle rollout

is done), we don't think it's practical to roll this out to the whole NA

Sales broadly under current status(it gives a lot of confusion if we do

official rollout).

What we'd like to suggest is that 1\) Trial by taking one example customer

to make sure the whole process flow works.

then, if all works well 2\) select a handful of accounts to start with (also

a small role out to the relevant sales team is required), and gradually

expand the scope of accounts if it works well.

We can definitely talk more during next week's call, but we realistically

think soft launching is the key even if everything works perfectly in terms

of Tools. Thank you.

Regards,

Kosuke OMORI

Omori san,

Many thanks for your verification and feedback.

We will try to put comments on your questions.

Meanwhile, as you suggested, we are verifying whether the E2E process is

workable properly as per your suggestion 1).

Once confirm it is workable, we will set another session to

show demonstration.

As for your suggestion 2), we totally agree with yours. We don't intend to

expand scope drastically from the beginning.

Soft launch would be preferable to get used to the new process / tool and

avoid Sales's confusion.(probably from end of Jan or Feb ?)

Let's discuss during the meeting next week.

Dear Omori san,

Happy new year\!

As we discussed in the last meeting, we would like to start Eagle X with NA

side gradually from February onwards.

In Feb, we would like to start with NA trade related business only, not

multi trade tenders.

Would it be possible for you to select some candidates and let us know?

(For example, 1 or 2 accounts/wk might be better in the beginning)

We will prepare the candidate account's preparation in Eagle X and arrange

the training session how to use Eagle X tool with related stakeholders

(Sales/Marketing)

Thanks & Regards,

Kazuki Masuda

Yes, we would prefer to start Eagle X for TPWB/TAEB at the same time.

Just taking an example, if NA Mktg select Eagle X accounts for Feb who have

both TPEB and WB related business, we Eagle X team will prepare pricing

tool for TPEB/WB respectively.

Appreciate if NA Mktg could select some candidates of Eagle X account for

Feb to make soft launch.

Sorry for being late.

I believe she nominated the Eagle X account for Feb since we already

nominated Signify as an E2E trial but let me check with her just in case.

Below well noted.

In case those accounts are Eagle X accounts for Feb, appreciate if you

could add them in the account list and share it with all trades.

Of course, we need to wait for Eagle X accounts for TPEB though.

Hi Omori san and Elizabeth,

Thank you for selecting the candidates for end-to-end verification.

We are almost done with the end to end verification for Singify and will

also conduct Cargill Cotton, Tyson Dry, & Ecolab accordingly.

(\*We would like to show the demonstration to the NA side. Let us set up a

touch point separately).

Also, we would appreciate it if you could  continue to select the NA

candidate accounts for February.

Here are the candidate accounts for February for Eagle X except NA accounts

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qzMdUlX59ZWbwi9sFTqGO\_B2QBs7PZxQCLmR2E9VDXw/edit\#gid=637690155

.

\* Among these target candidates, there are NA related tenders as well.

  Once we agree, we would like you to conduct Pricing by using Eagle X's

Pricing tool for NA related accounts as much as possible..

Let us discuss this further.

Thanks & Regards,

Kazuki Masuda

Nakai san, Masuda san,

Thank you for your update on this matter.

Let me recap what we talked about today so that the NA team can also

further prepare for next steps. Thank you.

1\. Gama planning process \+ overall Eagle-X flow (Award submission etc.)

Understand that the DYM team is also talking with the GCSM team to make the

whole process efficient and aligned.

Not only the point NA team had already raised(in the attached example), but

also including the whole process step by step especially from Sales

standpoint,

please kindly share the process idea as a whole whenever it's ready so that

we can understand the all steps comprehensively.

2\. Pricing Tool & Bid process trial

Next step is to do the trial through Signify bid(for TPEB) followed by

other bid examples for NA Export trades.

Once you're ready let's set up a call so that everyone can see how it

works.(target timeline; by Feb 9th)

3\. Candidates for TPEB tender to go through Eagle-X when ready

\*TPEB trade

CRO \-- Jasco Product (CHI0031B22)

ERO \-- CRSA(NYCB00314A: RFA)

SRO \-- CBOCS DISTRIBUTION(ATL0003B23)

WRO \-- Carparts.com (LAX0400B23)

\*we can further add candidates as the Eagle-X process goes smoothly.

4\. Latest TPEB bid working file

Please double check the attached latest TPEB bid working file including the

new MRG in it. Please let us know if you have any questions.

Regards,

Kosuke OMORI

Hi Tara,

Thanks for your comments.

Fully understood your good intention to allow sales to complete everything

in one file (ie by adding a separate tab for Supplementary Form). However,

it is not workable in terms of technical design and also does not fit to

the workflow of game plan discussion (GPS and RPS).

\*1. Game Plan Summary (GPS) \+ Supplementary Form\*

\- From the Sales's view screen, GPS (called "Customized Sheet") is a single

account spreadsheet containing multiple trades.

\- From the MKTG's view point, GPS (called "Master Sheet") is a single trade

spreadsheet containing multiple accounts. Each trade uses the same Master

Sheet by going to their Trade specify tab (eg TP tab) to review proposals

for various accounts.

Technically, it is not workable to have an additional tab of

Supplementary Form when MKTG reviews in the Master Sheet which

contains many trade-tabs already.  It is better to have MKTG team click the

link to get the specific account's "Supplementary Form" separately.

\*\<\< GPS (Customized Sheet) created by Sales \>\>\*

\[image: image.png\]

\*\<\< GPS (Master Sheet) reviewed by MKTG \>\>\*

\[image: image.png\]

\*2. Route Portfolio Simulation (RPS) \+ Supplementary Form\*

The same Supplement Form can be reused for RPS discussion.  For example,

AET currently requests sales to fill in this Supplementary Form when they

review RPS proposals. Sales can complete this form one time and reuse the

same file for both RPS and GPS discussion with various trades. It is better

to be an independent file (i/o adhere to GPS).

\[image: image.png\]

Hope NA Sales Management can accept SYM's enhancement.  GCSM will further

work with SYM to quickly complete enhancement plus UAT.  We target to

implement NA accounts before end-Jan.

Best Regards

\*// adding Imai san & Otsuka san for Eagle X Award / Filing process //\*

Omori san,

Thank you for taking your time today irrespective of the busy week.

Please find my comments below in blue.

\*1. Game planning process \+ overall Eagle-X flow (Award submission etc.)\*

  Game Plan Summary (GPS)

  We SYM are working together with GCSM and almost done with GPS sheet

enhancement based on discussion between GCSM and NA Sales management.

  GCSM will conduct a rollout session to NA Sales next week and separately

Eagle X team will also update NA Mktg team.

   Award / Filing process

   Imai san & Eagle X team are developing Award / Filing tool and aiming to

start quick-win tool after Mar.

   We are planning to rollout to stakeholders (GCSM, Trade, Sales, Filing

team etc) in Feb. Will keep you posted shortly once ready.

\*2. Pricing Tool & Bid process trial\*

   As Masuda san advised, we would like to have a call to explain the E2E

process (from bid sheet receipt to send our offer back to Sales) via Eagle

X. Let us arrange separately (by 9th Feb)

   Meanwhile, we have already prepared pricing tools \*by service scope\* for

Signify. Please find below link for respective Trade team's UAT.

\*   \[Pricing Tools\]\*

    You can get Pricing Data and Tool by using the following explorer

link. Please

copy and paste at your microsoft explorer.

   \- \-\* Pricing Tool :  G:\\Shared drives\\Eagle-X-TEST\\Sales\\FY24\\NA\\E2E

   Trial Pricing Tool\\G-US213512-Signify\*

         \[image: image.png\]

    As per your request, please note when CST cannot identify specific

location code at conversion stage, they will leave it as "USXXX".

    We are checking whether it is possible to technically change "USXXX" to

"US???" as USXXX is puzzling.

     \[image: image.png\]

\*3. Candidates for TPEB tender to go through Eagle-X when ready\*

    Thank you for sharing Eagle X account candidates under TPEB for Feb.

    Once you receive bid sheets, let's proceed via Eagle X process.

    @Elizabeth Small \<elizabeth.small@one-line.com\> / @Amy Whitlow

\<amy.whitlow@one-line.com\> ,

    Appreciate if you could select a few Eagle X account candidates under

NA export for Feb.

    In addition, we would like NA export team (DRY) to start using Eagle X

pricing tool for accounts under other region contracts (e.g. JPN contract).

    Believe you will get used to the Eagle X pricing tool / process through

test accounts but of course will keep supporting you.

\*4. Latest TPEB bid working file\*

    Please note that we have reflected the latest LT MRG for TPEB in the

pricing tool for Signify.

    In future, we Eagle X team will update LT MRG in the pricing tool

whenever GHQ TPTM share the updated LT MRG with us.

Best regards,

Koji Nakai

Thank you for the meeting last week.

We are converting 6 remaining accounts and will send you pricing tools as

By the way, Eagle X team is informing the upcoming Eagle X candidate

I would appreciate if you could select some Eagle X candidate accounts from

NA so that I can update the following list accordingly.

  This list is subject to change, as the timing of the tender can change.

Please allow me to respond regarding Pricing Tools.

As requested, we have changed the E2E Route assignment logic to read Dest

Route Cost (upto Dest CY Code) \+ Dest Truck Cost.

night SG time(US Fri am) for the session with Sales management team?

For this session, I would like to limit to Sales management only, then so

long as we can have a consensus with the NA Sales leaderships, we are able

to roll it out to relevant Sales teams at our end.

Flourance,

Thank you for your update regarding the pending point on Pricing Tool.

Reconfirmed the change you made, and it's working appropriately.

However, I found an error while I'm checking the file, and also would like

to know where we can find the Tutorial(hot to guide) of this tool.

I used the TP Domi file in the folder.

\- When we open the file first, should we update the linked information or

not?

Masuda san,

Thank you for your time to go through the process, I took some notes from

the call below

and appreciate your further review particularly on the first two bullet

points while the NA team will also work on the pending points.

Let us know if you also have some other points you'd need to highlight

to move forward. Thank you.

\*1 \- General concern about overall Eagle-X process\*

One biggest concerning point raised by NA Sales was about the whole Eagle-X

process particularly those Forms they are asked to fill up.

There are 3 Forms currently drafted for the Eagle X process and we'd like

to reconfirm the purpose and value of each Form to make sure the E2E

Eagle-X process flow will become efficient and valuable.

In short, NA team feel that some of the steps can be eliminated or modified

as those seem duplicated or redundant as we also have existing Eagle

processes today which can cover some of the points asked in the Forms.

We understand the DYM team is also talking with the GCSM team about those

points, so please continuously review these as a whole from a high level

process overview standpoint if there's any room to modify further.

Forms talking about.

Morning Masuda san / Yuesheng / Ben,

As per below, NA Mktg team shared some bid sheets in FY23 or FY24 with us

for E2E test.

As well as Signify, NA Mktg export team (Dry / RFR team each) is requesting

us to prepare pricing tool.

Fully understand CST is busy with Go Live tender but appreciate if CST

could prioritise NA accounts in order for NA Mktg to verify pricing tool.

Below is Tyson Foods. Will send separate email for the remaining accounts.

\*Dear Nakai-san / Masuda-san,\*

Further to below, just would like to share some updates on the 6 NA tenders

for E2E Test.

In view of the enhancement of the NA Conversion tool, we hold the

pre-conversion study of these accounts in the last few days.

But understand PWC already completed the enhancement this morning, so CST

can now start the conversion.

Anyhow, we have initially evaluated the RFQ File of those tender and

generally all are workable based on the Customer Sheets sales provided.

Masuda san and Ben,

Thank you for the conversion.

I was looking at TysonFoods ONE Format

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gApk4ZLGDJVF1UOlgtuSedyX4mh5rN3Z3qg8k4dPsI4/edit\#gid=1094299842\>

and noticed all POR / POL / POD / DEL appeared as \*US---\* or "\*Country Code\*"

\+ "\*---\*".

I am doubtful if this is what is required by NA MKTG, in which this will

require NA MKTG to fill up POR / DEL all by themselves, even for a simple

location like Kobe \= JP---?

Could you please counter check for safety sake? Thank you.

Hi Flourance,

Thank you for pointing that out.

You are right. As long as the master data can automatically capture the

location code, we don't need to change '---'.

In case master data can't identify, that portion will be changed to country

code \+ '---'.

Let me check with PwC today and get back to you.

Thanks & Regards,

Masuda san,

Understood PwC has updated location codes. However we are still seeing

simple locations like New York appearing as US---, and Pusan as KR---.

Could you please share the logic of how PwC picks up location conversion?

This has to be a clear understanding among EagleX members to handle NA

Tenders, therefore appreciate your sharing.

Hi Nakai-san, Flourance-san,

I've checked these 2 ONE Formats. Let's discuss how to avoid this.

Here is the logic:

   1\. In case of PIC01/02 \= NA, move to the next step

   2\. Check whether this POR/DEL/POL/POD codes are in column J \[③-1\_Place\]

   sheet.

   In case of yes, we'll change "US---".

   In case of no, we'll leave it.

The reason why some code were changed "US---", "KR---", "TW---" was

original codes were listed in col.J \[③-1\_Place\] sheet.

Next, I've checked why there were listed in  \[③-1\_Place\] sheet. If these

place are in the master, these are not listed in  \[③-1\_Place\].

USNYC case:

There is a "NEW YORK, NY" in the master as USNYC. But "NEW YORK,NY" is

written in HERSHEY customer sheet. So it was not matched. " " is missing.

KRPUS, TWKEL case:

As customer code is "ST JOHN'S", these are not matched.

Takuya Sano

Sano san,

Thank you for sharing.

1\. USNYC

Noted this is because of the " " (space) in between location and state

name. We will have to include this in \<③-O1\_Place\> and directly map as

USNYC.

2\. TWKEL

For Customer DEL St John's, we have no objection to leaving it as KR--- or

TW---.

However for Customer DEL specific as Busan and Keelung, we will have to

directly map them as KRPUS and TWKEL.

\[image: image.png\]

Shall we have a review and include more locations in \<③-O1\_Place\>?

Previously we requested to expand Place and Trade Mapping list in

\<③-O1\_Place\> and \<③-O1\_Trade Master\>, however it was declined due to G

Sheet limitation. Perhaps it is time to review our request.

If agreeable, we would like to prioritise those locations in NA Tenders.

Could you please assist to compile a list of locations with "country

code" \+ "---" from below 6 tenders shared by Benhur?

If PwC has a better idea to increase accuracy of location mappings, please

do not hesitate to share and discuss. Thank you.

Hi Flourance san,

Understood.

The problem is that current logic cannot distinguish St John's:KRPUS

from Busan:KRPUS. For example, if there is KRPUS in \<③-O1\_Place\> which

comes from St John's, current logic changed all KRPUS to KR---.

Let me check how we can avoid this issue. I'll check other 6 tenders too.

Happy Lunar New Year in advance\!\!

Hi Ben,

Thank you for the update below which is well noted.

I asked PwC (Sano san) to further check whether the current logic to put

"---" is correct.

He explained the reason for putting "---" but I understand there are still

some cases where he needs to check.

If he takes a long time, would suggest proceeding to create a pricing tool

by manually inputting correct location code in ONE Format considering we

need to share the Pricing tool for Test accounts with NA Mktg asap.

Flourance ric, if no objections from your end, let's proceed with the above.

Hi Flourance san, Ben san,

We've changed formula in ONE Format.

Initially we use col J in \[③-1\_Place\] sheet to change "---" but now we use

col B. After this change, Busan and Keelung are shown correctly.

I've updated the formula in the following conversion tool:

   \- Test env Conversion tool template

   \- G-US107419\_ECOLAB, INC

   \- G-US110336\_TYSON FOODS

   \- G-US125105\_J R SIMPLOT

   \- G-CA101800\_MAPLE LEAF

   \- G-US106791\_CARGILL

   \- G-US124256\_THE HERSHEY COMPANY

\*NOTE:\*

   \- We cannot distinguish the countries in Col B.

   e.x) In ECOLAB case, there are some "ST JOHN'S". Using Col B, we change

   all  "ST JOHN'S" to "---".

   \[image: image.png\]

   \- As R1 place mapping are automatically reflect to  ③-O1\_Place in R2,

   please delete values in row 2006 \- 4005 in ③-O1\_Place manually. Otherwise

   "---" formula doesn't work.

Hi Ben, cc Masuda san,

Randomly checked ONE Format, there remain some locations appearing as

"Country Code" \+ "---", such as GT Guatemala City, VN Ho Chi Minh, AU

Brisbane etc; and of course, US New York,NY because of the " " space issue.

We will need Location update in ONE Format before pricing tool creation.

Please let me know if CST or Conversion Unit can assist the same.

On the other hand, we will have to further discuss with PwC to expand

location mappings in Conversion Tool to minimise manual input by EagleX

team.

Dear Flourance /  Masuda-san,

After further checking on the below concern, we came up with some

workaround to somehow minimize the "---" location for the meantime.

Kindly refer to below set-up and let us know your insights

\*Current Location Code Mapping Logic for "---":\*

\- As per our checking, the trigger point of this "---" location code

mapping  is the  ③-1\_Place  sheet.

\- Logic:  Under ④ONE Format, If In case \*Customer Location Name\* is visible

in the  Place Mapping \- ③-1\_Place  Sheet, \*Location Code\* will be

automatically updated to combination of\* 2 \*letter Country Code \+ "\*---\*"

\- the source of \* 2 \*letter Country Code  would be Column BS \*(for POR)\*

and column BZ \*(for DEL)\* of  ①Customer Sheet

\*Workaround:\*

1\. Since the trigger point is the location code mapping  is the  ③-1\_Place

sheet and Location Names will only reflect on this sheet if it is not

visible in the OPUS Master data.

    Thus we need to ADD those Location Names into the OPUS Master Data

manually, so that it will NOT reflect in the Place mapping anymore, in that

sense. "\*---\*"  location code in ONE Format will not be auto-generated.

2\. Parameters:   We will only ADD those Location which CST are certain of

the correct OPUS Location codes and we will maintain those

ambiguous location names including the below set-up

   a. Y (for DOOR DEL)

   b. Y (for Group Location)

   c. Y (for Others)

   d. Y (If you cannot find OPUS Code, please input ZIP Code in Col.L)

\*Sample Output:\*

\[image: image.png\]

CSt is now updating the conversion tool of all the NA E2E accounts,

Will let you know once completed.

Thank you

\*Best Regards,\*

Hi Flourance

I'd like to share a few comments on the tool, per below.

1\) The "ALL Rates" tab shows DR rates only.

Is it possible to have the RFR FAK rates as well? The rates are available

in Tiger, and the scopes are TPW, WPW, OPW, TAE, LAS, LWS.

2\) The "E2E Route Summary" (column EQ) is not populating. The hidden tab

"Route" shows very few lanes only, so we couldn't properly test it (see

snip below).

3\) Would the "Cost 20'", "Cost 40'", and "Cost HC" cells (columns EW, EX,

EY) populate with RF costs once we flag a certain lane as RF? If not,

should we add columns for R2 and R5 costs?

Since there are no R2 or R5 costs in the hidden tab "Costs", we couldn't

test it.

4\) Similarly, the hidden tab "Fuel\_Matrix" still doesn't show the OBS

amounts for R2, R5.

The hidden tab "Dest\_Routing\_Matrix" doesn't show THD for R2, R5.

Basically, there's no data for RF.

5\) For chilled long haul moves, understand all truck rates should populate

in case we select "Oakland, CA" for example, in the Origin CY Hub (column

O) instead of the rail hub. However, again, R5 costs are not available for

us to test it.

6\) Can you please explain the "Hierarchy" in the "Origin\_Door\_Cost\_Matrix"

tab? For several locations, there's only "hierarchy 2" available (and not

hierarchy 1), so I'd like to understand the meaning of it (see snip below).

7\) Finally, can you please confirm MKTG will always be able to override any

pink cells?

Hi Pedro,

Thank you for your feedback.

1 / 4 / 5 / 6\. Current information is from NA Dry Export Pricing Tool.

In previous exchanges back in mid Jan, these concerns were highlighted and

we requested a copy of NA RF Pricing Tool for our reference. Appreciate if

you could share the same for our study on how we can link RF databases in

NA Export Pricing Tool.

In addition, there were exchanges between Amy and Nakai san regarding NA

Export MKTG's preference on whether we should split pricing tools for Dry

and RF teams. Appreciate your comments as well.

\================================================================

1\. To ensure we have the correct RF LTMRG, appreciate if you could share

with us the downloaded copy.

2\. Please click \[Refresh E2E Route\] in \<Worksheet\> tab then all the

available PriSim snapshot related to this tender lanes will be refreshed in

\<Route\> tab. \*\*\*Please refer to image in point 3.\*

3\. In \<Worksheet\> tab, Cargo Type is already shown as RF in column X which

E2E Cost for RF will be reflected in columns EW-EY after clicking \[Refresh

E2E Route\].

    RF E2E Cost can be viewed from \<Route\> tab. However we guessed some

confusion due to incorrect field names; we will rename to "20' / 40' / HC /

45'\_COST\_EPP" (from D2 / D4 / D5 / D7\_COST\_EPP).

    Whilst checking RF E2E Cost, regret we realised RF E2E Cost is the same

despite "RF-Chilled or RF-Frozen" change in column Y. We will review and

update.

\[image: image.png\]

7\. Please refer to NA TPWB Pricing Tool SOP

\<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UCZCsfTGusp9ZdzItW-Ak25No3\_phqZ2/present?slide=id.p1\>,

slides

5-7. Section 1.1 / 1.5 / 1.6 / 2 / 3 / 4 are from Customer Tender bid file,

which please avoid overwriting.

    Meanwhile, can we understand which columns / pink cells are you

referring to?

Please let us know in case of any other concerns or feedback.

At the same time, awaiting sharing on NA RF Pricing Tool. Thank you.

Hi Flourance

Please note that there's no "Pricing Tool" for RF MKTG. Currently, the team

would simply check the costs lane by lane using Opus Pricing Simulation

when working on a bid.

For very large bids (possibly Tyson Foods only), then the team may

download the costs from Tiger PRISM.

Can we please have a RF costs database created and added as well?

We'd like to test Tyson Foods, JR Simplot, Maple Leaf Foods and Hershey

with the RF data added.

We don't have a preference on a split pricing tool vs DR+RF combined.

Either way, maybe we can try a split version just so the file is not so

heavy?

As requested, please see the RF FAK rates attached \- TPW, WPW, OPW, TAE,

LAS, LWS scopes.

Finally, regarding overriding cells \- say the Pricing Tool calculates a

Round One offer of $1,000. Can we manually change this number?

Thank you.

HI Pedro,

Noted there is no dedicated NA Reefer Pricing Tool, and current approach on

how NA Reefer price for Tenders.

Thank you for NA Reefer MRG, well received.

We will consider creating NA Reefer Pricing Tool with Reefer Database. Are

you fine with NA Dry Export Pricing Tool layout?

If so, we would like you to also furnish below databases which are used as

direct formula linkage in Pricing Sheet (\* please unhide them from NA Dry

Export Pricing Tool to view the information). From my observation, below

are important and associated with costs,

   \- Origin\_Door\_Cost\_Matrix

   \- NA\_FT

   \- Fuel Matrix (\* GHQ EagleX Pricing Unit could assist to update however

   would like you to counter check if the grouping in column C is workable for

   NA Reefer)

   \- Dest\_Routing\_Matrix

\[image: image.png\]

At the same time I have also prepared a different layout version for

your reference, which is the existing Pricing Tool used by non-NA MKTG.

Please retrieve from below folder and attempt if this meets your

requirements as well. (\* though NA Reefer MRG is not available at this

moment).

Folder path: G:\\Shared drives\\Eagle-X-TEST\\Sales\\FY24\\NA\\E2E Trial Pricing

Tool\\G-US110336-TysonFoods

Filename: TysonFoods\_Pricing Tool (TP\_NonDomi-RF)\_nonNAversion.xlsm

Quick User Guide:

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rW4JOXPzV4pH92ETrNFzF\_upTD3vzHsv/present?slide=id.p1

Please let us know your preference.

Lastly, to answer your question, in either Pricing Tool version, Pricer

could flexibly overwrite Rate Offer as this is Pricer's decision to offer

as contract conclusion with Customer.

Please do not hesitate to reach out in case of any other suggestion or

feedback. Thank you.

Hi Flourance

Sorry about the delay.

NA RFR is OK with the NA DRY Export Pricing Tool layout.

As mentioned before, we currently don't quote bids using any database. The

team is working directly from Pricing Simulation.

Therefore, please download the data directly from Opus in order to create

the RF Pricing Tool. Note the RF NA\_FT should be per tariff, and Fuel

Matrix should be per tariff.

Thank you.

Hi Pedro,

Thank you for your message.

Please note the database for NA Pricing Tool is prepared by NA Dry MKTG

(similarly NA Import Pricing Tool is prepared by NA TPEB MKTG).

If NA Reefer MKTG prefers to use this version \- NA Pricing Tool, I am

afraid that you would have to follow up on the database preparation. I am

adding Kevin from NA Dry MKTG to guide you in the NA Pricing Tool database

preparation.

From GHQ EagleX team, we prepare only database which is for non-NA Pricing

Tool i.e. EagleX Pricing Tool.

If NA Reefer MKTG would still prefer GHQ EagleX team to prepare the

database, then we would strongly recommend NA Reefer MKTG to switch to

and conduct pricing via EagleX Pricing Tool. I have shared a copy of that

EagleX Pricing Tool in previous email for your attempt, have you managed to

give a try? What is the feedback?

At the same time I have also prepared a different layout version for

We spoke with Kevin since our last exchange, and he helped us create the

database for R2/R5. Please see attached and let us know if anything else

needed from our side.

Can you please update the tool accordingly so we can test for 1\) Tyson

Foods, 2\) JR Simplot, 3\) Maple Leaf Foods, and 4\) Hershey?

For consistency, our preference is to have the same format / template as NA

DR MKTG, i.e., the NA Pricing Tool version.

Hi Pedro,

Regret for the late response as we were tied with several project meetings.

Well received the database for TPWB RF, which noted it is related to RF E2E

Cost.

Would like to counter check if you would also prepare the database for

"Origin CY Hub" and "Origin\_Door\_Cost\_Matrix", which were related to your

previous enquiries (dated 05 Mar)?

5\) For chilled long haul moves, understand all truck rates should populate

Can we also reconfirm that "NA\_FT" and "Dest\_Routing\_Matrix" for TPWB RF

will be the same as TPWB Dry?

Once we received the information / confirmation, we will start creating NA

TPWB RF Pricing Tool same as NA TPWB Dry, also preparing E2E Pricing Tool

for your trial.

Hi Pedro,

Whilst NA RF team is conducting the trial using NA Pricing Tool, please do

not hesitate to reach out in case of any questions in the pricing process

Meanwhile we would like to inquire regarding Tyson Foods.

It comes to our attention that Tyson Food tender might be released in May

which is this month. We would like to counter check with NA RF MKTG on the

confidence level to conduct this tender via EagleX Process. Appreciate your

enlightenment and sharing.

Best Regards,

Hi Flourance

Due to the Tyson bid size, plus the fact that we haven't concluded the

tests yet, plus the fact that the RFR analysts haven't got training yet, we

are \*not\* confident that we can handle Tyson via EagleX Process.

Thank you,

Hi Pedro,

\*Tyson Food\*

Well noted. We will keep GCSM / Offshore team updated that this will remain

AS-IS Process.

\*Dairy Farm\* (tender from EAS region)

From separate communication, we noticed that NA RF MKTG encountered

challenges in conducting tender pricing process via EagleX NA Pricing Tool.

We would like to have a follow up session with NA RF MKTG to better

understand the challenges.

Please let us know your availability next week?

At the same time, we are glad to also conduct the training session of

EagleX NA Pricing Tool.

Best Regards,

受信: Thu May 23 2024 04:23:37 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Pedro Costa \<pedro.costa@one-line.com\>  
Hi Flourance

Thank you again for your time and the training session last week. I wanted

to share a few comments, per below.

1\) I see that seven lanes in the original "CustomerSheet\_R1" tab did not

get converted to the "Worksheet" tab. These lanes are IDs 553, 558, 563,

568, 573, 578, 583 (a).

IDs 553 USLGB/HKHKG (R5) and 558 USLAX/HKHKG (R5), for example, are lanes

that we can route on the PS7.

At the same time, lane IDs 550 USLGB/HKHKG (R2) and 555 USLAX/HKHKG (R2)

are for the same port pairs, and these are showing in the "Worksheet" tab

(b).

Can you confirm 553 and 558 were not added because these are duplicate port

pairs? If so, can you please explain how you are selecting the lane IDs

that will get converted? In this particular example, ID 558 was not

converted, and this is the largest volume lane, so I wanted to understand

the logic.

(a) CustomerSheet\_R1

\[image: image.png\]

(b) CustomerSheet\_R1

\[image: image.png\]

2\) Since this is RFR, can we remove the 40' and 45' columns throughout the

sheet?

\[image: image.png\]

3\) Can we label the NA Export Costs R2 and R5 instead of D2, D5?

\[image: image.png\]

Noted the OBS is updated to RFR.

Noted the OFT offer is no longer backing out the OBS.

Thank you,

Hi Pedro,

Thank you for your feedback. Please view our response as follows,

1\.

Lane ID 553, 558, 563, 568, 573, 578, 583 are in the Pricing Sheet rows

10-16 (highlighted in yellow).

Whilst Customer Sheet is vertical format (different container size per Lane

ID / row), Pricing Sheet is in horizontal format (20' / 40' / HC in the

same row), therefore 20'RF and 40'RH are appearing in the same row in

Pricing Sheet.

\[image: image.png\]

Lane ID 550/553 USLGB-HKHKG and 555/558 USLAX-HKHKG may look the same from

NA MKTG perspective, however they are regarded as different Port of Origin

in different rows in Customer Sheet. Whilst NA MKTG may offer PS7 for both

POR, please do overwrite SVC \= PS7 in column DG, and manually input E2E

Route Summary in column DQ.

\*\*\* POR USLGB on PS7 is not available from the previously shared Reefer

NAEXP Costs table, therefore manual input is required. \*

\[image: image.png\]

2\. Noted. We will counter check and hide 40' and 45' columns if they have

no impact on the existing formula / functions. Otherwise we will hide 40'

and 45' columns.

3\. Sure. Together with point 2, we will update changes in NA TPWB RF

Pricing Tool template.

Appreciate your continuous attempt in NA Pricing Tool and let us know if we

can further enhance it.

HI Masuda San,

Can I know if you have informed GHQ groupware of your requirements? As far

as I understand, I only received a request from GHQ Groupware for 4

licenses as per below.

Vendors only process orders as per what I have ordered to them. They will

not know the rest of the licenses you require.

\*Hi Lingling,\*

Can you check on Masuda San's 20licenses?

Hi Masuda San,

I think what Khloe is trying to explain is the 4 emails provided by you

have already been assigned this license.  So for others that is not within

these 4 persons. They will have to log in using either of the 4 people's

email below.

Take for example your email address another 4 users will have to use your

email to access the other 4 licenses.  Likewise for the other 3 emails.

Hope this clarifies.

HI Khloe, correct me if my understanding is wrong

## Questions about next rent contract

受信: Tue Feb 06 2024 13:30:11 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Kazuki Masuda \<kazuki.masuda@one-line.com\>  
Dear GHR IM team,

Good day to you. Let me ask the following questions.

1\.

The rent contract of the condominium where I am currently living is

scheduled to end on June 30, 2024 and I am planning to move out.

Am I correct in understanding that the start date of the next contract is

two months before the earliest, i.e., starting April 30 to the latest June

30?

2\.

I am currently engaged and have begun the process of getting married

(submitted Our Marriage Journey).

To live with my wife, I would like to get a budget as 2 Pax for my next

rent contract, but by when do I need to complete the marriage procedure and

submit the certificate? (Is it by the start date of the contract?

Also, I understand that the procedures on the Success Factor are needed to

be completed(Marital status and dependent). Please let me know if there is

anything else.

Thanks & Regards,

Kazuki Masuda

Dear Janet,

Thank you for your reply.

I understand that you will check the status with IM in April.

Since I signed a contract for only myself 2 years ago, the room is too

small for 2 pax.

I would like to move to a place where 2 pax can live together.

(I believe that the budget is also different for 2 pax)

Thank you for your clarification.

I would like to inform you that the GHR has revised the housing budget for

your position as Manager, and for a married couple without children, the

budget will be $6,450.

As per company policy, if an occupier decides to move out due to your own

curtains.

Hi Natan,

Thank you for compiling all the information

Can I assume that the Tender Release Month that you provided is meant for

the actual released month and we can refer to the provided release in FY23

to be considered for FY24? as an example for Empresas CMPC S.A. (EXP) we

will indicate in our status list to reflect 2024 M10 instead of 2023 M10.

Please also check through the folder link for the latest tender files, once

all is in good order, we will proceed to inform the CST-C team to conduct

Preconversion Studies accordingly.

be worked on should this be done in Live status regardless if the files are

the same.

\- Given this situation, we will create 2 sequences: Seq01 \= 1H (Assume

Month of November) and Seq02 \= 2H (Month of May)

\- Kindly advise if you're OK to proceed with this split.

(3) Esentia

Hi Leandro,

Please refer to my comment in BLUE.

(1) CMPC

\- Please clarify the correct SC/RFA Customer Code.

\- Based on the Contracts provided, correct code is CL504741 instead

of CL508336

YS: LA RHQ to check and provide further advice.

(2) COLUN

\- Given the difference in release period, there is technically 2 files to

be worked on should this be done in Live status regardless if the files are

the same.

\- Given this situation, we will create 2 sequences: Seq01 \= 1H (Assume

Month of November) and Seq02 \= 2H (Month of May)

\- Kindly advise if you're OK to proceed with this split.

YS: I checked the files, both are the same format and opine as per what

Flourance shared previously, as we are going to use 1H contract for 2H vice

versa when 2H is concluded, will use 2H for 1H. I checked the two period

tender files, the format is exactly the same. As such CST-C team will

utilise just 2H file to conduct their Pre-Conversion Study. On this basis

let's retain it as one Sequence number.

(3) Esentia

\- Is the correct Group Customer Code/Name as ff?

G-CO100605 | POLIPROPILENO DEL CARIBE S.A.

YS: LA RHQ to check and provide further advice.

(4) Nexa Resources

\- Can we confirm no active contract?

YS: Per LA RHQ sharing, please refer to iii. Tenders SC/RFA Contract\#:

\*TLIMB01331A \*if this is not active I am not sure if there are any other

RFA contracts which we seek LA RHQ to check and provide further advice.

Thank you

Hi Masuda san, YueSheng,

For those tenders released in 2024 Sep-Nov, they are for FY25 tender

negotiation. Opine we should update these in FY25 Status List instead of

FY24.

Therefore I suggest pending Status List update until this is ready for

FY25. So that we can keep a clean database for FY25 Status List including

TEST Status List.

What do you think?

Hi Flourance,

Regardless of whether the Tender is meant for FY24 or FY25, we will need to

reflect these LA RHQ Tenders in the Test Status list in order for CST-C to

conduct the preconversion study. Is it ok if we reflect this in only the

Test Status List but not in the Live Status List?

Thank you for your continued support of Eagle X.

As Nakai-san shared earlier, we would like to share the upcoming Eagle X

candidate accounts with Trade Marketing 1 month before go-live.

This will hopefully help with your tender recognition and preparation in

advance.

These are the January Eagle X candidates.

release, so this list is basically our best guess (subject to change).

\* We will keep informing you about upcoming month (Feb, March, April

release tenders)

If you have any questions about Eagle X, please feel free to contact us. We

will be happy to assist as much as possible.

こちらはあくまでTrade向けにどんなアカウントがEalge Xでくるかというのを1ヶ月前に事前Noticeし認識してもらうというのが目的になります。

「Pricing

toolをまだ使い慣れてませんでした」みたいなことがないように事前に準備して欲しいという意図になりまして、今後この1月分をメンテをしていくものではありません。

あくまで、正しいアカウントはStatus listでメンテンナンスしていきます。

また、1月分のアカウントのStatus listへのUpload遅くなりまして、申し訳ないです。

これは我々側の課題ですが、内部メンバーの休暇、及び手続きが煩雑化してしまっており、全部乗せ終わるのに今週いっぱいかかるのではないかと思っております。

よろしくお願い致します。

ただし、もちろん、リストは変動するものなので、あくまでその時点のスナップショットとお考えください。

Hi Masuda san and Flourance,

For Eagle X Jan offshore candidate Cargill (LATAM), GCSM would like to swap

this tender with \*Cargill (EMEA WAF)\* which is a new bid newly assigned by

the customer.

The reason behind is that we have a very tight timeline for Cargill (LATAM)

\- 19/Jan, while we have a bit more buffer for the Cargill (EMEA WAF) tender

(21/Jan).

Tender format is the same (GTN format) for this tender so we don't expect

any technical issues to process it via Eagle X. Appreciate your

confirmation on this swap so that we can inform CKAM and TST accordingly.

Thanks\!

Hi William,

We are ok with the swap but for safety sake let me confirm the timeline a

bit more.

\-19/Jan is Friday and 21/Jan is Sunday so I feel there isn't much

difference but is this correct?

\- Also,may I know when TST will trigger Initial Check In and when TST

expects to receive the pricing quotation?

Thanks & Regards,

Hi Masuda san,

Thanks for your agreement. Below is our response to your questions:

\-19/Jan is Friday and 21/Jan is Sunday so I feel there isn't much

difference but is this correct?

GCSM: To be specific, both LATAM and EMEA WAF deadline is under "PST" time

zone. Thus, we need to submit LATAM bid on 19/1 Friday Asia time. For

21/Jan PST it would be 22/Jan Monday morning Asia time.

\[image: image.png\]

\- Also,may I know when TST will trigger Initial Check In and when TST

expects to receive the pricing quotation?

GCSM: For EMEA WAF tender, TST have already downloaded the bid file from

portal and they are waiting for our go signal to trigger the Initial Check

In. We will instruct TST to do the Initial Check In accordingly.

Hi Masuda san,

I would like to give you an update regarding Jan Eagle X Offshore Tender

Candidate \*Moto Honda Export\*.

Due to extremely short timeline to process this tender (only 5 working days

for R1), GCSM have decided to release the bid manually instead of Eagle X.

Kindly refer to below milestone as reference:

Hi William,

Can you please elaborate why you didn't share with Eagle X when you

received the info from CKAM.

Since we selected Moto Honda Export as an Eagle X account, I wanted your

end to share that earlier.

Dear William, (CC: Masuda San)

Please note that we had Kesko Round 2 & AGC (Seq 1 & Seq 2\) this month

which we have processed via Eagle X with several meetings.

Kemira, YKK, Pioneer Tenders were Eagle X allocated Tenders but have been

directly handled.

We would request you to consider only 1 Eagle X Tender to be handled at a

time(Plus Subsequent rounds of any Eagle X tenders handled previously).

We have more than 25 Open Tenders now and it will be more in the next 2-3

months....Hence we are requesting you to allocate only 1 Eagle X tender at

a time as this is very time consuming and would impact timelines of other

Non Eagle X Tenders.

I think we have discussed it earlier also that we can only handle 1 Tender

in peak season.(Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr 2024).

Please advise further.

Dear team,

Just sharing for info on the feedback from TST WNS IN. Seems like they are

only ready to handle 1 tender at a time and ideally 1 a month 😅

I believed they are getting familiar and are able to handle more via Eagle

X for sure but possibly due to the overwhelming \# of tenders coming in.

Hi @Kazuki Masuda \<kazuki.masuda@one-line.com\> san, possibly we will need

to have a call with GCSM first to get an alignment and confirm our

directions once again with TST WNS IN.

Thank you

Hi William,

Though WNS India TST mentions they can handle only 1 Eagle X account per

month, basically we can't accept it as a management direction and we would

like them to handle at least the tenders which are agreed between GCSM and

SYM/DYM.

We would appreciate it if you would advise WNS India TST.

If WNS India needs any GHQ support, we are willing to support them. Please

let us know.

Hi Masuda san,

In fact, GCSM have clearly informed WNS India about the Eagle X Jan

potential candidate last Dec and we are quite surprised to see that they

did not consult or inform us about releasing those tenders in manual

process.

Also, we have not limited WNS India to only process 1 tender at a time as

Siva mentioned.

Judging from above, we will set up a clear guideline to TSTs and ensure

that they should escalate to GCSM should there be any deviations from the

Eagle X potential candidate which are agreed between GCSM and SYM/DYM from

Feb onward.

Hi Siva,

Pls note it is not acceptable to process those mentioned tenders in manual

process \*WITHOUT\* consulting either GCSM or SYM/DYM.

As we shared the Eagle X Jan potential candidate last Dec, WNS India should

inform GCSM immediately (also copy to Eagle X team) should you have any

difficulties to process those tenders via Eagle X and seek for further

directions.

GCSM have never confirmed with WNS India to limit to 1 tender at a time

during peak season. Do bear in mind that OMMC also started to process

offshore Eagle X tender from Jan and they have already processed/are

processing 5 offshore tender via Eagle X already.

Below is the list of target candidates in Feb which we expect WNS India

will release the tender via Eagle X.

Do let us know immediately if you have any concerns. Otherwise, we would

expect WNS India will process these tenders via Eagle X without fail.

Kindly be reminded that Eagle X is the company project for ONE and the

progress is monitored by our top management.

Please process tenders with Eagle X in accordance with the agreed account

list and give us your feedback whatever you observe under the live

environment. We know Eagle X is still imperfect. This is why, your fresh

feedback from your professional perspectives on the actual usage are really

essential for us to further polish up the process & the tools. Therefore,

please make sure to maximize the usage.

Meanwhile, the ultimate objective is the successful execution of live

tenders.  IF you encounter difficulties for you to achieve the goal, please

report it immediately. SYM/DYM and GCSM will definitely provide support.

We highly appreciate your good understanding & cooperation. Let's

work together.

Would like to confirm the status on Eagle X account (offshore) for Jan in

the end.

Do understand that there was misunderstanding between Eagle X/GCSM and WNS

but can I understand they proceeded those accounts via As-Is process in the

I as Project owner have to report to senior management on actual results

Tsunematsu san / Carmen,

As discussed during the weekly call today, regret noted that WNS handled

selected offshore tender accounts under WNS via As-Is process\* by

self-judgement.\*

Needless to say, such behavior doesn't accept at all and you need to

strictly control offshore in future to avoid recurrence as believe GCSM is

responsible for that.

Fully understand that we are on the same page. As long as we select as

Eagle X account, let's proceed via the Eagle X process.

In order to compensate this kind of WNS action, it would be better to

increase the number of target accounts. Please consider.

## Re: Eagle X target candidates for January

受信: Wed Feb 07 2024 16:22:52 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Daisuke Tsunematsu \<daisuke.tsunematsu@one-line.com\>  
Nakai san,

Regretfully the cases happened in the tender peak season while WNS (TST)

had been executing tenders under the strong pressure and the situation of

their manpower capacity tightened.

Having said so, obviously, it was not acceptable that WNS breached the

instruction and skipped Eagle X without any consultation to GHQ in advance.

GCSM ensure that similar cases won't happen in future.

A point we GHQ might need to assess carefully was that the offshore TST

reiterated their serious concerns during our review meeting that Eagle X

were increasing their workload and compressing their capability to execute

tenders during the peak season.

I believe that the common goal for both Eagle X and the tender management

is the successful execution of tenders to win more business. No doubt GCSM

will continuously support Eagle X, however we might need a kind of

flexibility for adjustment of the guideline to TST occasionally in order to

achieve the common goal. For sure GCSM will stay in close communication

with TST & SYM/DYM.

By the way, I would like to correct the status of WNS tenders in Jan.

Actually the following two tenders were executed on Eagle X with WNS.

\- Yokohama Rubber (EAS)

\- Asahi Glass (Originally it was not planned in the target account list but

executed on Eagle X with WNS)

Tsunematsu san,

Thank you for your feedback.

Fully understand that WNS are having their huge workload and hesitating to

prioritise Eagle X due to peak season.

However, I would opine they have to understand that Eagle X is one of the

biggest projects in ONE. Therefore they shouldn't excuse their workload.

Of course, Eagle X team keep supporting them whenever they need our

assistance.

Let's steadily build up our achievements for offshore tender as well as

onshore.

Koji Nakai

opening

\*RFQ\*

There is 1 part to the RFQ, for FCL dry & reefer equipment.

Please ensure you upload your bids no later than 3 working days prior to

\*DOCUMENTATION \*

You will find detailed instructions and supporting documentation within

this Bid Event. Please make sure you read and understand these.

   1\. Bidsheet Instructions

   2\. RPF Document

   3\. Cost Models / Lane Types

   4\. BAF Policy

We want to re-iterate the following:

\*RATES  \*

You must provide rates according to the specified Cost Models (Lane Types).

These are indicated in the Bid Sheet and explained in the Cost Model.

Service types are Door to Door, Door to TG, Door to Port, Port to TG, TG to

Door, TG to Port, TG to TG

.

All Providers must split out all the individual elements.

We draw your attention to the following:

   \- Your rates must be valid from 1 April 2024 through to 31 March 2025

   These rates will remain valid aside from BAF which is reviewed quarterly.

   \- Your Bids must be based on the elements & requirements as specified in

   the RFP Document, Operational Service Requirements, Special Requirements

   mentioned in the Bid Sheet and the Cost Model. Rates will NOT be subject to

   any other surcharges or rate increases.

   \- You must calculate your all-in rate by adding up the individual rate

   elements relevant to the Cost Model / Lane Type (convert local currencies

   to USD).

   \- Any incorrect entries will throw up an error message and you will not

   be able to upload your bidsheet.

\*CURRENCY  \*

All rates and rate elements must be quoted in the specified currencies.

\*RATE ELEMENTS  \*

You must split out each individual rate element as defined in the service

types. Enter ‘0’ where no value is required (e.g. no Pre or On-carriage for

TG and P moves)

A zero in any field means ‘at no (additional) cost to Simplot’.

Where a rate element is required according to the cost model and provider

enters ‘0’ this means that the cost is included on your ocean freight. You

cannot at a later stage charge for a rate element that was specified in the

cost model but was not populated in the bidsheet as part of your offer.

\*FOODGRADE\*

Some lanes require foodgrade containers. This has been specified in the

bidsheet itself. Please \*only\* add foodgrade surcharge for those particular

lanes. Enter ‘0’ where no foodgrade is required. The surcharge will be

included in the all-in rate and if you mistakenly include it for non

foodgrade lanes, you may not be competitive.

\*BL FEES\*

Origin B/L charges are fixed and in USD. For non US lanes, these charges

are paid by Simplot vendor and this aspect of the rate will not be included

in the all in rates.

BL Fees at origin are fixed at US$25 and NOT included in the all in rate

BL Fees at destination are in local currency and are included in the all in

rate

\*COST MODELS\*

These are specified in the supporting documentations which you can find in

this Bid Event. The cost model / Lane service type describes which elements

will be included in the all-in rate you can charge for each route.

\*BIDSHEET INSTRUCTIONS\*

A step by step, column by column guide how to populate the bidsheet is

provided on the platform.

\*BAF\*

BAF is according to Simplot BAF policy and adjusted quarterly. BAF values

Progress Eagle X team to discuss with PWC to come up with a viable solution

As per discussion with PWC, please note 180124 discussion point to have

CST-C to manually duplicate the files as there is not other ways from

system perspective to identify which are the files need to be duplicated

for different trade. TBA Eagle X Conversion Unit 190124: Eagle X team to

further discuss internally and align expectation for CST-C

180124: Eagle X Conversion Unit arranged discussion on 18th Jan 24 PM

This process will be handled manually by CST-C team as System aspect it

will be difficult to identify which files/which sheets need to be

copied/duplicated for different Pricers to input to avoid overwritting

previous Pricers input

Allow me to comment below. Do let me know your thoughts so that I can

arrange one Eagle X internal session based on the Draft Release Message

"Due Date Pricing: 2024-01-04 MNL TIME"

Section 5: Trades Involved

\*\* if sector/s falling under your trade have restrictions to quote/no

viable service, please send us notification; we will exclude you on our

follow up/reminder.

\*\* if there is a separate ongoing discussion between the account manager

and your trade, please advise for us to note such on your respective KPI.

LE Domi Pricing

LE NonDomi Pricing (For US)

LU NonDomi Pricing

YS: The Asterisk requirements \*\* are newly added that were not discussed

and would like to clarify the intention.

For first \*\* pointer, opine not required as the pricers' intention for no

quote reason will be updated in the pricing tool and during the

consolidated output. There should not be separate notification requirement🙏

For the second \*\* pointer, understand that this is to ensure the bid

requirement if there are any changes done where TST might not be in copy,

GCSM hopes that TST and GCSM will be made known so that we are aware of any

side agreement established between CKAM and Pricers. But I am not too sure

what you meant by "Your respective KPI"

What I visualized per expectation was to retain as seen below and if indeed

want to add Asterisk point, possible just manually add in second pointer.

To Pricer Grp for 'Pricing Trade File'

LE Domi Pricing

LE NonDomi Pricing (For US)

LU NonDomi Pricing

Looking forward to your confirmation on the above so that I can arrange an

internal meeting soon.

As per discussion with PWC, please note 180124 discussion point to have

CST-C to manually duplicate the files as there is not other ways from

system perspective to identify which are the files need to be duplicated

for different trade. TBA Eagle X Conversion Unit 230124: Interim solution,

CST-C will

For Duplicate Pricers' input File

1\. Duplicate other Pricers' input file and renamed it based on the \# of

Pricers involved instead of create separate columns in the same working

sheet

2\. During Consolidation to merge all Pricers' input back to customer origin

file

While Conversion Team will discuss further with PWC on this requirement:

1\. Duplicate Other Pricers' input file identified by CST-C and rename it as

required Pricers Involved

2\. Consolidation process to merge all the files into one file.

190124: Eagle X team to further discuss internally and align expectation

with GCSM to be handled by CST-C

180124: Eagle X Conversion Unit arranged discussion on 18th Jan 24 PM

This process will be handled manually by CST-C team as System aspect it

will be difficult to identify which files/which sheets need to be

copied/duplicated for different Pricers to input to avoid overwritting

previous Pricers input

GCSM: As TST will add the Tender Name manually, we can keep the original

SEQ and no adjustment would be required.

GCSM: The GAM/RAM hierarchy is mainly applied for GKA. For non-GKA, TST

will maintain the wordings for Account Manager/Regional Reps or equivalent.

GCSM: No objection to highlighting the deadline in "RED & Bold". Intention

is to keep the deadline more eye-catching only.

Other Input for Pricer as follow:

\[image: image.png\]

\-\> We would like to keep the above wordings, if any concerns, would you

share with us?

\-\> For \<Tender Key Documents\>, we suggest it should maintain in Section 4

with Summary of Bid Requirements as Pricers will only make reference to

these documents and are not required to provide input. If you have other

thoughts pls share with us.

\-\> As per separate communication, we find it is also important to remind

pricer to resubmit their offer in Pricing Tool. Thus, should we add some

wordings like "Please always resubmit your offer by Pricing Tool instead of

sending email to TST."?

GCSM: I believe it has already been covered and no issue to add manually by

TST.

\[image: image.png\]

GCSM: We confirm only Pricer related columns are required.

in the release message. We trust these info would also be covered under

Summary of Bid Requirements.

GCSM: As mentioned in above Pricing Tool section, Tender Key Documents and

Summary of Bid Requirement should fall under the same section. As these

documents are serving different purposes, it is better to show separately.

If the link of Summary of Bid Requirements and Conversion Checklist share

the same folder locations, we can consider to merge them into one row

instead of two rows.

GCSM: Agree this can be deleted since Pricer will provide decline reasons

in pricing tool.

GCSM: The KPI which TST mentioned is mainly for GCSM internal monitoring.

GCSM: Noted, if TST wants to keep it then they can keep above \*\*2. Below is

to be retained from Eagle X auto generated message. However, as a side

note, since TST are using different assignments on "Trade Involved"

(instead of SSG \+ Domi/Non-Domi), they may prefer to keep using the "as-is"

assignment. Let us go ahead with below SSG \+ Domi/Non-Domi assignment first

and further discuss if adjustments are required.

Hi William,

Thank you very much for your email.

Majority of the items look fine to me, let's have a quick catch up tomorrow

between 2pm to 3pm prior to the final alignment/sign off with all of the

stakeholders.

1\. Trust that below is the output image that you are looking for without

remarks.

\[image: image.png\]

2\. Eagle X template will retain as per what I provided as this will be

utilised by both Onshore and Offshore tenders. For Offshore TST handled

tenders, TST may shift Tender Key Documents into Section 4: Bid Package.

For the Tender Key Documents as per Masuda san's suggestion we will reword

to \<\<Please refer to the below link for “Tender Key Documents”:\>\> only

without elaboration of what it encompasses, if you wish to elaborate the

contents for Pricers' attention and any other supplementary wording, trust

that it is ok.

3\. For "\[40-2 Pricer input (Other than OFT)\]" this will be the new 40-2

folder name instead of "40-2 Other than OFT". On top of this we have

already sent to PWC to create \[Tender Key Documents\] Subfolder of 40-2

Pricer Input (other than OFT) for pricers reference where Conversion

checklist, T\&C summary and etc can be stored in there for Pricers' info.

You may inform TST to input the subpointers of what is inside this specific

folder.

Do let me know if the schedule works for you.

Target final alignment call to be held on coming \*Thursday 1st Feb 24

between 5.30pm to 6.00pm (Taking into the consideration that some

stakeholders have to do night shift.)\*

Hi William,

Appreciate you and Kiwi for taking out some of your precious time to get

alignment for the final parts to this email template creation for Offshore

tender mgmt.

The only pending part will be the \*Pricers' Responsible Tender column\*, I

will follow up with PWC to get a tentative timeline when can we automate

the creation of this output image in the separate worksheet stored in 40-2

Pricers Input (Other than OFT) subfolder \[Key Tender Documents\]

Other items are in good order and will leave it to your side to further

align internally with GCSM stakeholders and to proceed to implement this

for the next TST tender.

\*Other Item progress info (\*Not a withholding items and more of value

adding items):\*

1\. For the Other concern surfaced regarding the potential overwriting

concern, Eagle X will have follow up discussion with PWC and will provide

further update in due course.

2\. The other additional enhancement pointer that Eagle X requested PWC to

enhance for NAC Code and Name to be included in both the email subject

title and tender release to pricer email body content is in the review

process now.

Thank you

## Eagle X \- FR503452 BUTIntl \- post-mortem of R1 TCT tender process via Eagle X

受信: Fri Jan 05 2024 00:48:32 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Kasia Stannard \<kasia.stannard@one-line.com\>  
Dear All,

Please let me share short post-mortem of first TCT tender handled by Eagle

X \- just to see what we can improve for the future (& how much of delay was

caused by Eagle X & how much by usual business in tender peak season):

   \- Tender was released on 18th Dec with internal deadline 22nd Dec \- it

   may seem a reasonable timeline but it fall during busy pre-Xmas week & 22nd

   Dec was half working day only in EUA

   \- Initially there was a mis-communciation between Pricer & OMMC on

   mandates/surcharges terms resulting with OMMC needing to redo Eagle X

   pricing tool input

   \- Due to being unfamiliar with Eagle X Pricing Tool, it took Pricer a

   longer time to review OMMC input

   \- I believe OMMC Eagle X Pricing tool input was efficient

   \- There was also confusion on TT/routing input \- please note that for

   Eagle X tenders, routing details will be generated by the Eagle X pricing

   tool (so OMMC for TCT tenders) as long as it's available in TT Tool

   \- Apparently rates generated in EX Pricing tool were approx $3 higher

   than Pricer mandate \- it may be linked to the ROE for some surcharges but

   would appreciate if GHQ Eagle X team could review it

   \- Again, due to unfamiliarity with the tools it took Pricer slightly

   longer to export/submit rate file so CST can proceed with conversion back

   to the customer format

Based on my discussion with Pricer, if practically possible, it would be

good to request input back from OMMC \*a day before the internal deadline\* \-

just to give Pricer time to check OMMC input properly while getting

familiar to EX Pricing Tool.  Would it be possible for OMMC to guide

pricers on which columns need to be checked (like O/F, OBS, THC)? It may

speed the process up especially while we are still learning Eagle X tools.

I would also like to remind Pricers that they have GHQ Eagle X support team

on hand while dealing with Eagle X tender for any quick question (chat or

VC is the quickest way based on EUA Pricers experience) \- details can be

found on the portal here

Dear Kasia,

The summary given below is fair.

Only one comment to add from my side, the figures for our RND1 offer in

EagleX were rather small.

For the next time, I have a go with Eagle X is there any possibility to

make the figures larger (easier to read) and prevent any incorrect pricing?

Thank you.

Hi Barbara,

Sorry for belated. Thanks for your comments.

Just to confirm, can I understand the figures were small even if you zoom

in the pricing tool.

As you are aware, the pricing tool is just an excel file so you can change

zoom in the file.

\*Adding Sang for his info.\*

Hi Masuda san,

Just to provide you with the quick update here regarding the conversion

study status:

\*EAS and SAS Perconversion Study \- GHQ Internal support.\*1. Only assigned

Evan, Sang and KaWah with the conversion study to update Masterdata based

on the latest Tools version where all tenders are workable tenders.

2\. Evan has not started as he was away for year end vacation (clearing his

leave)

3\. Sang completed his review for Mitsubishi Elevator and I have yet to

review it, will do so today as separately updated Sang on this.

4\. Top Victory for 2024 M02/03 release will be assigned to Sharon for

conversion study. This will serve as a good practice for her.

\[image: image.png\]

\*LA RHQ Preconversion study:\*

1\. Sumidenso needs to add in our Test Status list and suggest an assignment

to Sang while Lau san, Sharon or myself can be the GHQ internal reviewer. I

would strongly propose to let Sharon hands on to be internal reviewer so

that she can be more experienced to support during live tenders.

2\. Comercial ECCSA S.A  as checked in test status list COMERCIAL ECCSA S.A.

(RIPLEY), conversion study completed back in September. Below FYI and lets

check with Nikko later this afternoon.

\[image: image.png\]

\*On top of the above, \*

1\. Followed up with Giselle on the status for G-FR105395 SIPLEC (Sharon) \-

pending Sales submission of Tender bidfile. No positive update on this yet.

2\. Followed up with Ces to obtain G-ID101039 Asia Trade Logistics  \-

pending Sales submission of Tender bidfile

Thank you

Hi Karin and Cali,

Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

Well noted that Customer has requested

1\. Add in new lanes for this tender,

2\. Highlighted deletion of duplicated lanes info as well as

3\. Pricers to consider if they would like to revise the Pricing Offer

considering the Red Sea situation where customers may accept a premium

surcharge to ensure their cargoes get onboard our vessel.

Please allow us to review this internally on the best approach to handle

this request.

Hi Karin,

Thank you for your confirmation.

After further internal discussion, taking into the consideration that we

need to review the gaps/changes made from what Pricers offered for R1

submission to our customer VS the newly added request from customers.

As such please proceed to submit Initial Check-in as \*R2 process. \*

Do let me know if you need any support from my side to fill in this R2

Initial Check-in form.

\*In R2 process there is no requirement to fill in the conversion checklist

which was completed in R1.and we will need your help to specify the

adjustment made for R2 in the initial check-in form last question as seen

below:.

\[image: image.png\]

Please specify the following three pointers in this Form under this portion

so that we can kick off the conversion process accordingly.

1\. Add in new lanes for this tender,

2\. Highlighted deletion of duplicated lanes info as well as

3\. Pricers to consider if they would like to revise the Pricing Offer

considering the Red Sea situation where customers may accept a premium

surcharge to ensure their cargoes get onboard our vessel.

Hi @Cali Yaptangco \<cali.yaptangco@one-line.com\> and @Nikko Jim Geronimo

\<nikkojim.geronimo@one-line.com\>,
