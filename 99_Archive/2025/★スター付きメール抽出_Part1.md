\*///EU ETS related clause///\*

\*In recent years, the emphasis on controlling greenhouse emissions has been

growing both globally and regionally. In order to comply with the latest

requirement by any country, region, international organization, including

but not limited to the European Union (EU), United States of America, and

IMO, on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by adding container shipping to

the Emissions Trading System (ETS), there may be an increase expected in

the overall shipping cost. Subject to the latest developments, ONE may

implement a surcharge or revise the base freight in accordance with the

additional cost of such compliance. ONE will ensure cost transparency

towards our customers in case such regulation comes into effect. If you

Dear Partner,

Good day.

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to propose a rotation change for the \*HYUNDAI VOYAGER0160E\*

due to the "Hot delivery" cargo situation as a one-off case.

The proposed new rotation is as follows:

SVC

AX4 / FLX

VESSEL

HYUNDAI VOYAGER

Original

Rotation

MXZLO-CNNGB-CNSHA-KRPUS-MXLAZ

Proposed

Rotation

MXZLO-KRPUS-CNNGB-CNSHA-MXLAZ

Expected

Schedule

\*MXZLO- KRPUS (12/14) \- CNNGB (12/21, same with LTS) \- CNSHA (12/22, same

with LTS) – MXLAZ(1/13)\*

This change offers the additional advantage of increasing the likelihood of

an on-window arrival at Lazaro port, even in the event of severe congestion

at E-bound ports.

As you are aware, the recent weather conditions in the North Pacific have

been worse, so this adjustment will also help us to reduce the effects of

weather variables.

I look forward to your positive response.

Dear Ann

Usually PUS is our T/s hub and they are at the last port to get all SEA/ISC

and ROB cargo onboard

If she is put as 1st call , she will have the same BW as BKK Bridge

@Kazuki Masuda \<kazuki.masuda@one-line.com\> Understand from Wed meeting

Wansan commented  BKK Bridge currently have 700 \-800 TEUS booking  on her .

Can you check if it is from SEA/ISC cargo which T/s at PUS ?

If together with NGB and SHA 's booking on Hyundai Voyager ETA 22nd Dec and

25th Dec  (can check from allocation ) will you expect her to be full?

Let's assume BKK Bridge is a VMS ( she is pending to phase out to SX2)

Dear Pei San,

BKK Bridge currently has a total firm booking of 814 TEUs. Of these, 726

TEUs are loaded at PUS, including 216 TEUs that are transshipments from

SEA/ISC.

On the other hand, Hyundai Voyager still has weak bookings at around 30

TEUs (the forecast has not yet been fully input).

However, together with bookings from BKK Bridge, I expect the Hyundai

Voyager to be full.

Thanks & Regards,

Kazuki Masuda

Have you checked any impact for SHA/NGB wayport to KRPUS on that week?

Believe should not have any backloading issue but wayport issues have you

checked with ECM?

Dear Ann,

Good day.

I hope this message finds you well. As previously discussed, the HYUNDAI

VOYAGER will proceed with the rotation change to PUS-NGB-SHA.

To avoid any ROB issues in PUS, it is necessary to designate PUS

discharging for Empty containers from Latin.

Currently, the MXLAZ Plan shows no discharging cargo for PUS. If there are

plans to load cargo at PUS, please ensure that the PUS discharge is

designated from MXZLO.

Failure to do so could result in unnecessary re-handling due to the

co-mingling of cargo during COD operations.(HMM will not proceed the COD)

Therefore, I kindly request you to confirm this matter with the ONE Latin

local team to ensure smooth operations.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

## Re: TGL ONE // Imports from KR \+ JP to CLIQQ Used Cars 40'HC

受信: Wed Aug 06 2025 10:29:45 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Esmeralda Hernandez \<esmeralda.hernandez@one-line.com\>  
Good morning Dear @Adele Chia \<adele.chia@one-line.com\>  and @Kazuki Masuda

\<kazuki.masuda@one-line.com\>\!

According to our last CGM presentation,  we have an opportunity with TGL

S.A. They have a Family Business in South Korea and Japan and their partner

Be Forward Co Ltd (The shipper) is interested in managing cargoes with ONE

of used cars from main Japanese ports and KRPUS.

The total prospect is around 10 and 15 40'HC weekly to CLIQQ.

We had a meeting with TGL S.A. and they explained us this is an excellent

opportunity to close a regular cargo and a long term busines.

The proposed target are:

1\. All origin surcharges \+ OFT USD 2800 \+ destination surcharges (special

CAS around USD 90\) for all main Japanesse ports and Pusan.

2\. Validity between 1 or 3 months.

Be Forward Co Ltd explained that the short validity time of FAK is not

workable.

Below you can find the last FAK rates received from Boon Keng Lua reviewed

with the customer.

We are very attentive to your comments, thank you\!

Dear Soon Ang / Kazuki,

Noted. Customer indicates the cargo initially cleared via the automatic

clearance channel (green channel), meaning no physical or documentary

inspections were required. However, customs reassigned it to a controlled

channel, indicating they have selected the cargo for further review. It is

currently undergoing this control process, and a favorable resolution is

expected on Thursday the 24th.  And the cargo is still at the terminal.

Dear Masuda san,

Sorry to cut in. I was OOO and returned today and I immediately got the

call from Starcargo in regards to this case.

What we normally do to push customers to pick up containers, especially

long stay ones, is to assure that if they pay the demurrage and work on

return empties we will negotiate a discount after. The total amount

incurred was USD 38,430. All containers were returned on July 24, 25 & 26\.

Is it possible to offer a 30% discount?

Dear Adriana,

Thank you for sharing the situation.

After careful consideration, we are able to offer a discount of up to \*USD

5,000\*, which represents \*13%\* of the total demurrage amount incurred (USD

38,430).

I  hope this support demonstrates our willingness to work with Starcargo in

special situations.

Summary

Someone in Alerce (CLSCL-Nueva Apoquindo Torre 2, L4) and Loreto Aravena

discussed various aspects of market performance, customer relationships,

and operational challenges. They reviewed market growth, service

performance, cargo composition, and customer concerns, emphasizing the

importance of strategic account management and addressing market dynamics

like declining rates and vessel capacity issues. Loreto Aravena confirmed

efforts to expand Sparks' portfolio and discussed Tricot's negotiation and

the inability of the origin side to support FAK cargo, while someone in

Alerce (CLSCL-Nueva Apoquindo Torre 2, L4) highlighted the company's focus

on securing better-performing customers, optimizing vessel capacity, and

addressing booking cancellations and communication issues, aiming for

strategic growth despite market challenges.

Suggested next steps

Someone in Alerce (CLSCL-Nueva Apoquindo Torre 2, L4) will talk to the team

about having the same rates and the waste of resources.

Someone in Alerce (CLSCL-Nueva Apoquindo Torre 2, L4) will go back to the

team and explain how much is saved on anti positioning for every container

sent to the south, and share the guidance on the EP advantage per TU.

Someone in Alerce (CLSCL-Nueva Apoquindo Torre 2, L4) will return the

information about the cargo to the north.

Hi Billy,

On overall, we are expected to exceed 33TEUs / 1,650 mtons at this moment.

Attached is standby list of 116TEUs / 2,463 mtons.

Please prioritize \*using the 1st tab first\*, but since this is a

LOT-booking(1BL=10containers), there is a possibility of excessive rolling.

As an adjustment to improve utilization, please roll the cargo listed in

the 2nd tab.

1st      : 57TEUs / 1,621MT

2nd-1 : 37TEUs / 537MT

2nd-2 : 22TEUs / 305MT

Please proceed to close BNVT2530E.

Your cooperation is highly appreciated.

Best regards,

## Shift IQQ used car shipment to AX4 NLVT0007E via LZC to AX1 IMET2531W

受信: Thu Jul 31 2025 14:36:45 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Catherine Bae \<catherine.bae@one-line.com\>  
Dear Soon Ang, Ko,

We are requesting support for a critical backlog of IQQ-bound used car, pls

you review?

The issue stems from a reduction in our AX1 service BSA, which was

decreased from 290 to 200 TEUs for July.

This has forced us to roll a significant volume of shipments, with some

used car cargo now having been triple-rolled.

As a result, our customers are urgently requesting a solution to move their

accumulated volume.

To lessen the burden, could you pls consider loading a portion of this

backlog onto AX4 NLVT0007E for t/s at LZC onto AX1 IMET2531W?

Sorry for such a request but we MKTG support to solve this issue.

Volume min 30 units

Total volume expected on AX4 NLVT0007E

POD TEU UNIT

CRCAL 10.00 8

GTPRQ 43.00 25

CLIQQ 60 30

MXLZC 59.00 31

MXZLO 66.00 38

TOTAL 238.00 132.00

## Re: Shift IQQ used car shipment to AX4 NLVT0007E via LZC to AX1 IMET2531W

受信: Thu Jul 31 2025 14:58:39 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Ko Murakami \<ko.murakami@one-line.com\>  
Hi Catherine

We believe that the reason the used cars backlog increased significantly is

not due to the BSA on AX1 for July, but rather due to the Move Count (UNIT

basia) restriction at IQQ.

As AX4 also has a Move Count limitation for T/S cargo at MXZLC, the

proposal you suggested would be difficult to accommodate.

For this week BNVT2530E, we have increased the number of loadable units

from KR to abt 90 units. However, is the situation still challenging?

Taking into consideration the bookings for IQQ from other origins, we are

already making maximum efforts to increase the capacity.

Your cooperation is highly appreciated.

Best regards,

The Ningbo office is proposing to adjust slightly higher than the HLC / COS

rate to reduce the backlog.

In view of RR action, booking coming in has slowed down \- some customers

most of the subjects to roll booking have been canceled by customers.

Used car volume is averagely 50 TEU/week. There is a surge on week 34 to

300TEU per week due to the MSC rate being higher than ONE by Usd300 and

booking flooded to us.

JP is controlling the booking as mostly is to CLIQQ so there are move count

issues.

normal at the end of Sep. Volume is slowing down.

waiting confirmation from Wan San / Simon \]

equalise MX FAK / T1 rate as WCSA in view of the various draft restrictions

across the AX loop on AX1 \- 4\.

4\)  We maintain CLVAP rate higher by Usd200/F against MX to curb the volume

due to CLVAP draft restriction and also huge CLVAP backlog.

## LAWC Report Week 30 \- 2025

受信: Wed Jul 30 2025 08:26:36 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Helga Timmermann \<helga.timmermann@one-line.com\>  
 Good Day,

please note this week report

\*1. Vessel Performance:\*

\*AX1: Seaspan Belief  2522: \*PECLL: Movs adjustment,  32 movs per BSA

however we loaded 61 // IQQ: Only discharge \+ BO reefers // PAG: Only 72

units loaded from 98 C\&R.  Arauco affected by a fire in one of their

plants,  and also impacted by a global demand reduction due to the tariff

war.

\[image: image.png\]

\*AX2 : Seaspan Benefactor 2519: CLCNL, PECLL WB, CTC MXZLO omissions. CLLQN

& MXLZC only discharge operations   and Bari: CLCNL & SSA MXZLO omission\*

\[image: image.png\]

\*AX3: ONE Orinoco result with an extraordinary 115% in tonnage with 40,839

mtons and 537 plugs.\*

\[image: image.png\]

\*AX4:\*

\[image: image.png\]

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b43KgFVhLOe1RIDOWUnR-q6z5-ERRG2-z-WIDFr6HEg/edit?usp=sharing

\*2. Long Haul Market environment \*

   \- From Ecuador market share, we closed the first half of 2025 in second

   place, behind CMA, in Dry exports to the Far East, holding a 16% market

   share comparing with 8% of last year.  Our main export commodities include

   SOC empty containers, balsa wood, cacao, and teak wood. During this period,

   we loaded a total of 4,452 TEUs, an increase compared to 4,196 TEUs in the

   same period of 2024\. Contribution Margin per TEU has remained stable,

   averaging around USD 320\.

   \- In the case of reefers, it’s a similar situation. We hold the second

   position to Asia after CMA. Our market share increased from 17% in June

   2024 to 20% by June 2025\. Our main export commodities are shrimp, bananas,

   and broccoli. During this period, we loaded a total of 12,770 TEUs, which

   is an important increase compared to 8,756 TEUs during the same period in

   2024\. Contribution Margin per TEU also improved, going from USD 597 in 2024

   to USD 1,014 in 2025\.

   \- For dry cargo, the trade has allocated us 10 boxes per week to Tanjung

   Pelepas, which we expect to fully utilize with cocoa shipments. On the

   reefer side, we continue closely monitoring market rates to stay

   competitive and keep growing our volumes and market share. At the same

   time, we are also running promotions through ONE Quote for the larger

   vessels.

\*3. Intra Latam Market Environment \*

   \- We are strongly promoting the NOR cargo from MX to WCSA countries (EC,

   CL, PE and CO). We are pushing the customers to accept the equipment

   substitution considering very competitive and attractive rates.

   \- In July, OQ´s volume showed a slight decrease compared with June,

   reaching 1,823 TEUs for ILW scope. Best performers were Peru, Ecuador and

   Colombia, with 1138, 250 and 167 TEUs, respectively. This represents 31,9%

   of total short-term volume for dry cargo.

\*4. Operational constraints:\*

   \- AX1 MANZANILLO EXPRESS 2527 will perform a COR between MXLZC and

   MXZLO.

   \- AX1 ONE SAPPHIRE 2523 will have movs restriction at CLIQQ.

   \- AX1 ONE SAPPHIRE 2523 will not perform the COR between CLPAG and

   CLIQQ.

   \- AX2 MSC VIRGO 0524 will call MXLZC HUTCHINSON i/O APMT.

   \- AX2 ONE SPLENDOUR 2522 will omit CLCNL to protect the schedule

   integrity.

## Action Needed: Eagle-X Missing Target Routes – Prism VS All Routes for PRD setup \[16/07/2025\]

受信: Wed Jul 16 2025 15:04:54 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Josephine Wong \<josephine.wong@one-line.com\>  
\*//PLEASE DO NOT REPLY TO ALL\!\!\!//\*

Dear trade and marketing team, cc: @sg ghq bi prd

\<sg.ghq.bi.prd@one-line.com\>

As part our regular exercise and analysis to support end-to-end (E2E) route

coverage expansion, most especially for tender pricing, DYM COA Team has

identified port pairs that are currently missing from the Product Catalogue

(PRD) Set Up.

Dear EUA IOP,

For your information, Eagle X Team has been actively conducting this

exercise, especially given the number of \*Europe/Africa Door Terms\* across

the respective trades listed below. We appreciate your support in working

alongside the Trade and Marketing teams to review the routes.

\[image: image.png\]

To address this, Eagle X Team have compiled a list of missing routes and

segregated it per trade in the following Google Sheet which we require your

usual cooperation to review and share your inputs: \* Eagle-X Missing Target

Routes \- Prism VS All Routes 16/07/2025

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m6F1nOR8hqvYqVuAhxjo3sZXz48iTwSXGsTRteHen7Q/edit?usp=sharing\>\*

As guidance, what needs to be done are as follows:

1\. Navigate to your respective trade tab in the said sheet (service scope

coverage of each tab is summarized in the \*\*Instruction\*\* tab)

2\. Review the listed port pairs (columns A to J) and complete the required

input format/template in columns M to AD

3\. Such input format/template is necessary for the PRD team to complete

labelling/registering the said missing routes correctly in Product

Catalogue.

\[image: image.png\]

\*For the Pricer’s Comments, please select from the available dropdown

options (e.g., Need Route Creation, No Service, etc.) only. If you have any

other reasons other than the listed options, can approach me or @GHQ DYM

EAGLEX \<ghq.dym.eaglex@one-line.com\> . \*

\[image: image.png\]

⏰\*Deadline\*: Please complete your inputs by \*Friday, 25/07/2025\*.

Hi Everyone,

Thank you to those who have completed the review of the missing routes

\!\!\! 🫰🏻

For those who haven't, we understand that the number of routes to review is

quite substantial, and some of you may be on vacation. To accommodate this,

we are extending the deadline to \*31st July\* (end of month), so that

everyone has ample time to complete the exercise.

Besides, please note that we have added a new column in each tab " Tender

Volume " for your reference.

Hi Everyone,

Thank you to those who have completed the review of the missing routes

\!\!\! 🫰🏻

For those who haven't, we understand that the number of routes to review is

quite substantial, and some of you may be on vacation. To accommodate this,

we are extending the deadline to \*31st July\* (end of month), so that

everyone has ample time to complete the exercise.

Besides, please note that we have added a new column in each tab " Tender

Volume " for your reference.

Hello Josephine,

Please find attached IET Non Domi AE feedback in column K.

As pointed out previously, majority lanes require only door link. These

should not be sent to MKTG. These lanes should be separated out and sent

direct to IOP team.

Where we have inserted 'No service' or 'No offering' please ensure these

lanes are not repeated on future reports.

Thank you & best regards

Routes have been added, but it would help us a lot if the mode of transport

is being advised.

For the below route, mentioned on the list is POL: BEANR, but advised is

DEHAM which have been updated.

Is the route to BEANR still needed ?

受信: Thu Jul 24 2025 03:51:47 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Adriana Naula \<adriana.naula@one-line.com\>  
Dear Masuda san,

We received today's notification regarding the RR and promptly forwarded it

to our customers. We immediately received feedback that carriers are not

applying it for the NOR, and the target shared by Starcargo is quite low

compared to the current MRG. We understand the importance of achieving the

200 NOR target and are committed to working towards it by retaining our

current accounts and actively pursuing new ones.

To have a look on the NVO NOR market, here are the top 10 NVOs and their

carrier preferences.

TOP 10 NOR NVO JAN \- JUN 2025

Starcargo keeps leading and we have 79% market share with them and from the

overall ONE has 28% of the share.

To keep this trend with the account, we would like to now if we can match

Dear Adriana,

Please note that ex-Malaysia (MYPKG), we are currently facing a heavy roll

pool situation with 200–300 TEUs already on hand.

Given the space constraint, we will not be releasing any rate. We kindly

request your support to cancel the booking accordingly.

Also, USD 1800 is difficult to match.

Dear Masuda san,

Booking is firmed. We have monthly shipments from Starcargo ex. MYPKG, is

it possible to honour the space granted?

Also, 2100 is not accepted since in the local market there are not such

levels. Can we offer a revision?

Our customer has informed us that the local market rate for NOR is around

1400, so the current proposal does not align with market conditions. Would

it be possible to propose a revision?

Dear Masuda san,

I hope this email finds you well.

Adriana is on vacation, pls let me share info received from Starcargo

yesterday. Fyg, CMA is contacting the customers to offer their service from

Asia to GYE with low rates and good transit time on their service M2AG.

They are offering service in Cosco's vessels. Have you heard any news about

that?

CMA is offering rates between USD 1,200 \- USD 1,400/NOR so,  could

you please review one more time the rate request sent by Adriana before? It

is needed to keep us as the main carrier for NOR and increase our reefer

stock.

We have shared the indicated rate level with the customer and received the

same feedback. They have base port rates of USD 1,200 (validity: August

1–7) and USD 1,400 (validity: August 8–15).

order to maintain this trend with the account, we would like to know if it

is possible to review the previously submitted rate once again, to align

Hi PeiSan,

We consolidated feedbacks from the sales offices.

\[image: image.png\]

We will have big BSA in Week 41 (10031TEU).

We proposed to have a blank sailing on AX2 (VIST0539E) in week 41\.

With our proposed blank sailing, BSA reduced to 7386TEU, which is the

reasonable BSA during the Golden Week (when the production is only

partially resumed).

Thanks & best regards,

Regret to inform you that our space situation is currently very tight.

Please manage bookings based on the BSA.

If too many bookings are released relative to the BSA, in this already

tight space situation, multiple rollovers are likely to be required.

Your understanding is highly appreciated.

\*Dear Adele,\*

Well noted, please find the revised list as attached, total 91 teu.

Meantime, we will check for the space acceptance on AX4. Thanks.

\*Dear Masuda san,\*

Understood we already swapped the space from NLVT0007E to HIIT0111E.

But in order to manage the PUS backlog, would appreciate your support to

check if possible to have extra 34 teu on NLVT0007E.

The final loading on her will become 36 teu. Thanks.

Dear Simon,

Basing on customer's market feedback, please assist to review if we can

adjust rate to keep us in line with market level.

Please find customer's proposal as below table, and your comment is

appreciated.

/////////////////////////////////////////

\*FAK rate to MX/WCSA:\*

HMM \---USD 1800/40’NOR

WAN HAI \---USD 1900/40’NOR

HAPAG-LLOYD \----USD 2000/40’NOR

EMC---USD 2000/40’NOR

The above rates are competitors’ FAK rates. It is obvious HMM/WAN HAI’s FAK

rates are lower than our special rates and Hapag-Lloyd/EMC’s FAK rates are

same as our special rates.

 On the other hand, our VIP accounts whose commodities are low-paying

cargoes response our rate offers are higher.

 Thus, in order to maintain the shipments of our VIP accounts via ONE/LOFF

mutual service, please consider the following rate proposal

(decreasing USD 300/40’NOR and adjusting Callao rates same as other WCSA

ports).

Dear Masuda

Good day,

Nice to meet you, welcome to our market.

Kindly note there is an agent locally with FRs from CNSHA, they are

preparing cargo for 3 FRs from CNSHA, but they always try to look for ONE

vessel to get faster confirmation and space.

Therefore they want to know if we can confirm the rate for the ONE ORINOCO

2530E \- ETD 06/08.

EX CNSHA to ECGYE USD 6000 /40FR OWOH

EX CNSHA to ECGYE USD 5000/20OT

Awaiting comments.

Dear Masuda

Good day,

Thanks for your counter offer, but today we received the MRG for the first

week of september, and POL CNSHA is offer above the MRG, could you please

revise the proposal:

EX CNSHA to ECGYE USD 6000/40FR OWOH

Kinda confusing since I checked the attachment, but tiger says the rate you

mentioned.

Otherwise, pls help us with comments regarding the increase in the last Q3

to inform the agent as well, cause they have an offer from CMA with 6000

USD for CNSHA, but their clients don't like it cause they arrived in

Posorja terminal.

Awaiting comments.

Dear Erick,

Previous offer was 40FR OH, not 40FR OHOW. We can't offer the same rate

level for OHOW.

Also, if the following is also considered OHOW, the requested level is too

low to match.

## Re: AP rules for LE/LW trades

受信: Thu Jul 17 2025 04:08:18 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Natan GONZALEZ \<natan.gonzalez@one-line.com\>  
Dear Team,

LW Domi Marketing: Gloria Yip

LE Domi Marketing: Soon Ang Chong

GHQ Account Plan PICs: Imai-san and Wan Yan

Following the initial discussions we held a few months ago regarding the

Account Plan (AP), we are now revisiting the topic after further alignment

with the LAM Front Offices. Several areas for improvement have been

identified, and we’ve summarized these insights in this file

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kgYfZ4NsL3EsHS4MErs3OzZ7ND0Wqo63h7pEj7StiJQ/edit?gid=952638222\#gid=952638222\>.

We’d like to share them with you to initiate a dialogue and jointly explore

viable solutions.

Our main goal is to enhance the effectiveness of the Account Plan—driving

better performance and ensuring it accurately reflects the realities of the

Latin American business context.

As a region, we've already refined the suggestions based on our discussions

with the LAM countries. We’re now keen to further this conversation by

gathering your feedback and assessing the potential for joint action to

strengthen the management and performance of the AP.

To support this, we’ve included dedicated columns in the file for your

input: \*Column F: LW Domi Mktg; Column G: LE Domi Mktg; Column H: GHQ

Project Owner\*

Once comments are added, we’d be happy to schedule a call to align on

feedback and define next steps collaboratively. Thank you in advance for

your contributions. We look forward to your thoughts.

Regards,

Hi Kazuki,

This was something that I am doing everyday.

Which is to update the space situation for all AX1,2,3,4 first thing in the

morning.

This was a recording I did when I pass this to an ex colleague.

You can first try to go through this recording first when you have time.

I'll try to show you how I do this and why when I am in office. Probably

early next week.

So at your time, you can view this recording at your leisure and we'll go

through next week.

It is ok if you do not fully understand, but at least when I show you,

these things won't be totally new to you.

Dear Murakami San/Remi

Sorry for jumping in.

Actually,Xingang are always facing tight BSA on both feeder and MV

vessel.For this large bookings without AP ,we may not be able to accept it

as per customer's request due to limited feeder and MV space.We suggest to

inform customer in advance that if they accept our offer and will place

booking,they need to adjust their volume flexibly according to our

suggestion.

Rollover at Xingang or Busan may be happened.

## LAWC Report Week 28 \- 2025

受信: Tue Jul 15 2025 06:58:52 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Helga Timmermann \<helga.timmermann@one-line.com\>  
Good Day,

please note this week report

\*1. Vessel Performance:\*

\*AX1:\*

\[image: image.png\]

\*AX2 :\*\*ONE Spirit is being prepared though the coast targetting over 62000

mtons.   Draft from Callao affected the total declaration in 6000 MTONS.

From total vessel 109K to 103K.  But we are confident to fulfill in

Mexico. \*

\[image: image.png\]

\*AX3: ONE Orinoco result with an extraordinary 95% in tonnage with almost

34.000 mtons\*

\[image: image.png\]

\*AX4:\*

\[image: image.png\]

\*FLX: as from vessels departing this week we are targetting 100% plugs at

Ecuador departure.\*

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b43KgFVhLOe1RIDOWUnR-q6z5-ERRG2-z-WIDFr6HEg/edit?usp=sharing

\*2. Long Haul Market environment \*

   \- So far during the FY we have loaded an average of 38 TEUs/WK to

   Oceania, representing 123% increase compared to last year. The main

   shipments are from Chile and Mexico, with an average CM/TEU of USD 1,112.

   Key accounts include Woolworths, Kawasaki, Commodity Supplies, and BGA.

   \- We’ve seen a significant increase this fiscal year in both dry and

   reefer cargo to Japan. Dry cargo liftings are averaging 434 TEUs per week,

   which is 45% higher than the previous year. Reefer volume stands at 509

   TEUs per week, representing a 16% increase over the last term. The CM/TEU

   is USD 279 for dry cargo and USD 993 for reefer. Main accounts for dry

   cargo include Celulosa Arauco, Mazda Motor, Hillebrand Mitsui, and

   Marubeni. For reefer, the key customers are Farmind, Reybanpac, Sumifru,

   Grupo Porcícola, and Agrosuper.

   \- \* Due to AX2  Callao NB omissions and operational restrictions,

   Fishmeal projection will be reduced from 6500 to 4500 mtons.  2200 mtons

   are expected to be loaded between August and September, hoping service will

   face no major disruptions.\*

\*3. Intra Latam Market Environment \*

   \- During June the cargo to Europe (LWU scope) reached the 337 teus.

   Ecuador, Mexico and Nicaragua were the main performers with 124, 88 & 66

   teus respectively. 50% of the total volume is RF cargo.

   \- We have received the Samsung SDS 2H tender nomination. The total

   awarded vol. for this new period is 210 teus per week (88 Teus ex MXQRO \+

   122 Teus ex MXTIJ). The main destinations are Colombia, Perú and Costa Rica.

   \- Finally in June OQ´s volume showed an important increase compared with

   May, reaching 2,427 TEUs for ILW scope. Best performers were Peru, Ecuador

   and Chile, with 1525, 354 and 221 TEUs, respectively. This represents 31,1%

   of total short-term volume for dry cargo.

Es correcto Héctor, ya que el cliente solo aprueba pagar 5 mil dólares.

Debido a que el caso se volvió incobrable, ¿podriamos escalar el caso con

Pricing?. Lamentablemente al ser un cargo HAL, AR no lo puede escalar como

caso de Write Off.

Quedo atenta

Gracias

Dear Jinwei ,

From intial message \- the DD incurred is Usd22302 ; I have granted Usd5K

discount waiver.

Will Shipper take hold on partial payment? or cnee will pay?

Dear Hector,

Yes \- we need to exhaust all options before we escalate to TM for waiver.

Please get back to Jinwei and have a last try before we consider any

further % discount waiver.

And in the event we do go up to higher % \- why do we need to consider

Usd17K waiver.

Dear Soon Ang Chong,

Pls refer to below message from Shipper.

Shipper also consider it's not customer reason to cause so huge detention

And apply our ONE if can support more discount as one off case.

Dear Chen

This shipment felt in stays charges because was subject to a PAMA

(detention for administration process).

According to customs law, the truck companies are obliged to take truck out

when cargo is subject to PAMA.But the truck line didn´t follow the process

to take out truck as mexican customs law demand.

The customer believe that if your trucks had met the requirements in a

timely manner, there wouldn't have been so many demurrage charges.Please

kindly help us reapply to check if they can only pay USD 5,000.

Hi Ron

I understand that, due to an inspection by the authorities, the truck was

held for 22 days, resulting in a cost of USD 22,302, which the customer is

now refusing to pay.

We also understand that we need to check whether the shipper could possibly

assist with covering the cost.

Although this is slightly outside the scope of our actions, I have a few

questions.

I reviewed the earlier emails after translating them, and it seems that

although the truck was detained for 22 days due to the inspection, the

actual inspection only took one day.

The customer is arguing that the 22-day standby charge is excessive.

This is regarding the HAL, not detention — but was the trucker assigned by

ONE?

I had assumed that the charges from the trucker were being passed on to the

consignee as HAL（Inland additional charge）.

In this case, neither ONE nor the consignee seems to be at fault.

Technically, the consignee may be the party responsible for the payment.

However, are the trucker's charges even legitimate?

From the translated emails, it appears that, legally speaking, the truck

should not have been held for 22 days if the trucker had made the proper

filings.

Your cooperation is highly appreciated.

Best regards,

Dear Ko,

This shipment is to the door. When the exact inspection took place \- we do

not have control.

When the cargo is released to trucker and send to customer \- the

destination team has a clearer picture if need to check further

Custom inspection may not only be filing \- might be due to documentation

submitted incorrectly or the custom have some suspicion on illegal stuff

etc. etc.

But again \- custom inspection ; out of ONE's control \- we cannot interfere

with local authorities' checks.

Trucker charge is legitimate but the DET is under ONE charge because of the

equipment usage exceeding the freetime

So if we really want to check further \- is the actual container charges \-

the rental diem per day as compared to the DET we have collect if base on

Usd5K is sufficient to cover the cost or not.

If i remember correctly ; should be around Usd6 dollar per day so \- the

next step ; cnee already blacklisted \+ can only collect 5K \- then need TM

approval \+ see when we can have our container back

Desde el mes de noviembre se ha intentado cobrar el cargo HAL en el BL

cubierto 14,480.00 USD y tiene pendiente de pago 1,700.00 USD.

El cliente ya cuenta con el bloqueo en OPUS, pero nos gustaría tener un

acercamiento con ellos; lamentablemente ya no nos toma el teléfono y nos

gustaría validar con el área comercial el que podemos tener una visita a

sus instalaciones y de esta forma presionar para el pago. Ahora bien,

podemos enviar la cuenta a la agencia de cobranza pero en este caso no

podríamos ya desbloquear al cliente para futuros embarques y es importante

tomar en cuenta que 1 de cada 15 cuentas se ha tenido la recuperación.

Good morning Hector, Since November, we have attempted to collect the HAL

charge on BL NB4IV8484700. A discount was applied to the initial amount and

billed USD 22,302.00, but to date, the client has not responded. Regarding

delays, they generated USD 16,180.00, of which USD 14,480.00 has already

been covered, and USD 1,700.00 remains outstanding. The client is already

blocked on OPUS, but we would like to connect with them. Unfortunately,

they no longer answer our calls, and we would like to confirm with the

sales department that we can visit their facilities and thus push for

payment. However, we can send the account to the collection agency, but in

this case, we would no longer be able to unblock the client for future

shipments. It is important to note that 1 in 15 accounts has been recovered

\*Dear Soon \*

The customer incurred charges totaling $37,825.00 USD (Detention, CVC, and

TAD). They have paid for Detention ($15,480.00) and CVC ($43.00), but the

TAD charge of $22,302.00 USD remains unpaid and is now 429 days overdue.

After multiple attempts to contact them since July 2024, the customer has

responded with an offer to pay only $5,000.00 towards the outstanding

amount. Their account was placed on a "soft warning" in December 2024 and

escalated to a "hard stop" in March 2025\.

We recommended the following options

\*Option 1: Pursue Full Collection via External Agency\*

   \- We send the account to an external collection agency. It is important

   to note that this agency has a low success rate, historically recovering

   payment for only 1 in 10 similar cases.

   \- If collection is unsuccessful, we will receive a letter of

   uncollectibility and would then need approval to write off the full amount.

   \- The customer's account will remain on a "hard stop" blacklist.

\*Option 2: Accept Settlement Offer\*

   \- We accept the customer's offer to pay $5,000.00 USD.

   \- We would then request your approval to write off the remaining balance

   of $17,302.00 USD.

   \- The customer's account will remain on a "hard stop" blacklist.

Could you please advise which option you would prefer for us to proceed

with?

Thank you for your guidance on this matter. Please let me know if you

require any further details.

Best regards,

Saludos.

Dear Boss @Kenny Gwee \<kenny.gwee@one-line.com\>

We have a long idle case back in 2024 due to custom inspection \- PAMA

checking

Ocean freight and local charges already paid. Empty container was returned

in November.

Total DD incurred-  Usd37825 ; partial DD Usd15480 already collected \-

pending Usd22032

Cnee has been blacklisted. Shipper not willing to pay any amount.

Cnee is only willing to pay Usd5K to close the case ; so the local office

is requesting a waiver for remaining Usd17K.

\*Option 2: Accept Settlement Offer\*

   \- We accept the customer's offer to pay $5,000.00 USD.

   \- We would then request your approval to write off the remaining balance

   of $17,302.00 USD.

   \- The customer's account will remain on a "hard stop" blacklist.

\*I would support their proposal ; would you please review if you can agree

to waive Usd17032.\*

Yes \- it will remain on hard stop as it raises questionable behavior due to

custom inspection and also the financial capability on the cnee in the

## LE/LW Domi Tier 1 criteria review

受信: Mon Jul 14 2025 16:09:37 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Wan San Tan \<wansan.tan@one-line.com\>  
Dear Jenny, Winky, Gloria, Simon, and Soon Ang,

Given the recent upsizing of our SX services and the ongoing upsizing of

AX,

I would like to use the upcoming Sales meeting to redefine our Tier 1

account criteria.

Our current criteria will be too low with the larger BSA.

Please see below for further details.

\[image: image.png\]

\*Suggest New Minimum Criteria Tier 1 \*

LAEC Not less than 40 teus/wk  ( Not automatically qualify, only if there

are strategic needs.)

LAWC Not less than 60 teus/wk  ( Not automatically qualify, only if there

are strategic needs.)

LE/LW Not Lesser than 120 teus/wk ( Apply for ac having strong support for

1 lane but demand for T1 overall LA)

\* GKA FF continue to qualify for T1 even performance falling below the

above criteria.

(however this should not be automatically qualified, discussion and

justification still be required from ac mgr)

Additionally, local established RFA accounts to be evaluated individually.

I've also included tables illustrating the current and proposed Tier 1

criteria and their potential revenue impact, along with a list of current

accounts by LE and LWE.

\------------------------------

Background

This initiative is co-led by the GHR L\&D and GVO teams and encompasses

programme design, scheduling, and logistics. Its purpose is to deepen

understanding of vessel operations and foster collaboration between ship

staff and ONE office employees. Several GVO colleagues have already

completed the programme.

\------------------------------

Learning Objectives

   \-

   Understand day-to-day vessel operations and cargo work

   \-

   Observe and identify gaps in port and cargo operations, fuel management,

   and arrival/departure processes

   \-

   Learn about the challenges faced onboard and bring back actionable

   insights

   \-

   Strengthen collaboration and rapport with vessel crew

\------------------------------

Programme Details

   \-

   Target Participants: non-GVO/RVO (non-operational) office employee

Eligibility Criteria:

   \-

   FY2024: Strongly Meets Expectations or higher

   \-

   FY2023: Exceeds Expectations

   \-

   Minimum of 3 years of service at ONE

\------------------------------

Eligible Employees from Your Department

   \- Kazuki Masuda, Africa & Latin America

\------------------------------

Important Considerations

This programme involves 7 to 9 days onboard a vessel, including flight

travel. The next batch is tentatively scheduled for the first week of

September 2025, subject to vessel availability, with subsequent runs

planned quarterly. Nominated employees will attend a briefing session

conducted by the GVO team, where programme details and expectations will be

clearly explained. Employees will have to confirm their interest and

availability after this briefing. Please plan ahead with nominated

employees to manage workload and project commitments, as they will need to

be released from duties during the programme. Participants should also be

prepared for limited connectivity and basic onboard living conditions.

\------------------------------

Next Steps

Please confirm the interest of the nominated employee(s) by replying to

this email by 28 July 2025 if possible. A 'Nil' reply is appreciated if

your employee is not keen on joining this programme. Final selection will

be made by GVO, and successful candidates will be notified with next steps.

\------------------------------

For any questions, feel free to contact John Lim or Leena Sidhan from GHR

L\&D.

Thank you for your continued support.

Dear Maria,

As Mentioned, we did not heard of such low rates in the market and that

offering rates at the level you've requested could severely undercut the

local market rate levels and pushing rates even lower.

To note, rates should not be lower than Starcargo as well which I pushed

back to maintain my previous offer if needed.

Dear Saman,

I have seen you have input 50TEU for CGM for LK; where the average lifting

is only 30TEU.

Any reason? If not i would like to ask you to trim down to CGM proposal by

MTKG.

adding @Boon Keng Lua \<boonkeng.lua@one-line.com\> to follow through.

Dear Soon,

Reason for the request for 50 teu CGM for LK, is to push for more volumes.

However, we will trim down the CGM as per the proposal by MTKG.

Hi Soon,

The addition that it widers of variance is facilitated by Nestle

(RFA\#PKGB01011A). As this is an oversea Contract, & we've been advised no

need to cover in the AU LW AP.

After checking we've received nominations from Nestle to MX as 96 x R5 per

year, which is avg out as 3 teu/wk ex from AU.

To align it with the actual booking that we're getting, hence the Sales

Target input as 17\.

Please advise if we need to adjust it down to 14 to align with the AP.

Best regards,

Dear Kelly,

Nestle RFA is Malaysia \- the AP needs to reflect in Malaysia AP not AU.

AP is only considering the RFA contract office AU.

Please adjust down to 14 TEU and resubmit the file

Hi Kelly

Noticed the below  , please adjust

1\) Under DRY\_RF in TEUs tab , you have to consider your RF in units figures

as well

Add it in and it has to tally.

But do note , RF is units so when you convert it to TEUs , please add on

accordingly.

2\) Then after you filled in your RF in units target , you can use the

remaining target to fill in Dry Account Plan , so overall your number in

Dry\_RF in TEUs cannot be over the stipulated MKTG proposal.

3\) Account Plan Tab have to equal to DRY\_RF in TEUs tab as well , currently

the account plan does not tally with sales target.

Hi Adele,

Thanks for your checking. For most local NVO a/cs, their cargo is a mix of

both NOR/RF and DRY cargo(major portion is NOR), so we didn't tick RF flag

in the AP. This is also the same practice of our current AP(below Aug AP

for your reference). And as we monitored, their performance can be well

restrived in the AP review file without RF flag ticked. Could you please

kindly advise if we could maintain RF flag un-ticked?

Hi Boon Keng,

Yours noted and allow me to step in as Kelly is on leave today.

Can I ask why we need to shift 1 reefer plug from  AX3 to AX1? Is it due to

tight space?

All the reefer we are currently carrying / targeting on AP is to MX ports

(MXZLO, MXESE, MXLZC) so provided we can have sufficient space coverage

this should be ok.

Hi Bryan

this is because we have to follow as per the sales target due to

the limited space we have on AX3 , hence we have to shift it to Ax1.

You can shift the MXZLO bookings to MXZLO. Many thanks for your assistance.

Thank you.

Hi Ron,

Apologies for the delay. Please find attached the missing data regarding

the contract term.

At the moment, we are forecasting higher volumes for September than the

agreed in this file (already sent by Josue, but not accepted at all).

Let's use the attached figures as a baseline, and please allow us to make

minor adjustments along the FY.

We will be sending our revised proposal for September by today in the

separate follow up.

We've just received an update from the customers. Both CMA and HPL are

adjusting the R5 rate to 2000 for the second half of July. Given that our

VVDs are fully booked in July, we suggest adjusting our rate to 2200 for

MX/LAWC as per the proposal. Your support would be appreciated.

Dear Soon Ang

Thanks for your counter offer. I see you're willing to support the LAWC

rate and are aiming for a higher rate on MX. However, your proposed rates

for MX are above our special offer for the first half of July against

the market trend. I suggest we extend the MX rate until the end of July and

apply 2200 for LAWC from July 16 to 31 as the attachment. Please consider

this proposal.

## Re: Congestion at Zhanjiang, hard stop implemented \- RF RATE REQUEST

受信: Thu Aug 14 2025 15:12:02 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Vincent Liu \<vincent.lau@one-line.com\>  
Dear Soon Ang

As discussed in the 2H meeting, we understand that due to port congestion

in MX, we need to closely control R5 acceptance, with PE/CL/GY as the top

priority. However, competitors are still offering the same basic market

rates, and rates for the second half of August remain low. According to

customers, CMA/HPL are offering $1,600/R5, valid until the end of

August—significantly lower than our current offer.

Since our vessels are still full and we must selectively accept R5 bookings

based on destination, we propose extending our 1H rate while adjusting

rates for non-PE/CL/GY destinations, and applying $1,800/R5 for PE/CL/GY,

valid until the end of August. Please review and consider this proposal.

Dear Rena

Pls help to provide a rate sheet accordingly.

Dear Vincent,

We have no interest to take Usd1600/R5 while in general the market is

pushing for RR.

Note that the R5 market is different but NPRC is still able to do at above

Usd2200/R5 \- so I do not see any reason for me to match at Usd1800/R5.

Morning Simon

We have stepped away from the live reefer market for some time due to the

previously tight space situation.

As the market has now eased and we have plenty of R5 units available, I’m

considering whether this is a good time for us to re-engage in the live

reefer business.

Please find the latest market rate updates from J-Shine, Keenly, and

Prospect for your reference. Kindly review and consider supporting this

proposal.

Valid till end of Nov.

HPL: 1500 with  3days free plug at destination.

CMA: 1600 with 3days free plug at destianiton.

COSCO/OOCL: 1600 with 5days free plug at destination.

ONE current offer: $2500 with no plug, 2800 with 3days plug.

Proposal for the VIP customers only:

YTN, SHK, ZHA, HAK/LAWC, MX:   $1500/R5 (no plug-in)

YTN, SHK, ZHA, HAK / MXESE:  $1600/R5 (no plug-in)

YTN, SHK, ZHA, HAK /CRCAL,SVAQJ: $2500/R5(no plug-in)

POD Freetime \- 10 calendar days free line detention; port storage and

Dear Simon

Noted with thanks. However, due to market competition, the live reefer rate

always dropped to a low  level during this slack period, as most carriers

focus mainly on repositioning equipment for Latin export demand.

ONE previously held a strong market share at SCN (over 3000T last year),

but we have lost a significant portion due to rate issues (lost almost

2000T in 2025), This has resulted in a significant deficit in our regional

budget, and the frontline team is under pressure from GRBP, RHQ, Country

management, and the CF department. etc..

Given that space availability is now improving and the current market rate

can still generate a positive CM, we sincerely hope GHQ can support us in

regaining a litlle bit market share, at the time being. Kindly review and

reconsider our proposal.

Dear Vincent,

Adding on to Simon's point.

For NPRC, the live reefer rates are no where near this level at the moment.

If this is market reality for SPRC that the live reefer rates are that low,

then we would rather look at going after dry business instead.
