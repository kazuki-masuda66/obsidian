Adding Masuda San & Eagle X team to the communication.......

Dear Yugo Fukai San,

Hope you are doing well\!

We would need 10 working days from the receipt of the bid to Pricer's

deadline for all the bids and It would take 2 days approximately(For bids

which are not very complex) for Eagle X conversion process.

This is a coordination of Sales+Offshore+Eagle X support \+ Pricers for this

process to complete on time and accurately..

We will try our best to maintain the accuracy and timeline for the bids

listed below.

Thanks & Regards,

Dear Yugo-san, Nakai-san, Masuda-san, and Tsunematsu-san,

As we await further guidance from GHQ Eagle X on how to proceed with the

matter below, I’d like to share some additional data for your reference.

The sample calculation provided (from JPN Sales) demonstrates a very tight

timeline, requiring both Conversion and Pricing to be completed within 4

working days. Historically, as shown in the table below for the mentioned

accounts, this aligns with typical practices. On average, the Pricing

deadline from receipt is about 6 calendar days, which translates to

approximately 4 working days.

\=== quote \===

※N Count : Working day

N+0      : Dec 2 (Mon) Tender Release Date \= Package receive from customer

N+1      : Dec 3 (Tue) Initial Checkin→WNS replies Eagle X T\&C file to

sales, Sales check contents

replies.

completes the Conversion, \*RFQ is sent to Pricers finally. \*

Dear Pedro & Siva,

Thank you.

For Sony specific exchange, pls return us your comment over the email ⇒  Re:

Prechecking process of SONY BID for FY25. We need urgent

decision/escalation as tender will be received next Monday.

Overall, as Siva mentioned, is WNS not able to complete the process below

(total 9wdays until consolidation) ?? (KPI days are changed/prolonged ??)

As we would like to utilize Eagle X as much as possible, pls confirm your

acceptance of my previous proposal \- to have planning between WNS and sales \*in

advance\*. (this is between TST and sales, we do not need GHQ Eagle X team

authorization)

Dear Pedro,

Thank you for your time online.

1\. We will let sales approach you and Siva for pre-planning \- just like

SONY case.

2\. If/when we find using Eagle X prevents sales to submit on time we will

escalate our proposal to GHQ Eagle X team.

3\. Noted that the timeline KPI is unchanged as per the diagram.

Needless to say, we Japan would try our best to proceed with Eagle X as

much as possible, together with WNS team.

Brgds,

Yugo

To further reduce cycle times for offshore teams, we would like to automate

delivery so that notifications reach the right people when they are needed.

To do this, we would like to ask about purchasing Looker Studio Pro licence.

## HKGでのDiscussions

受信: Mon Nov 25 2024 08:00:00 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Kenichi Michida \<kenichi.michida@one-line.com\>  
\*仲井さん、増田さん、\*

こちら、HKGのTender Support Teamとの打ち合わせをベースにして、幾つかポイントになる点を取り纏めましたので、ご展開申し上げます。

打ち合わせ時にPresentしていた資料は取り寄せ中です。

\*RPSについて\*

1\) KAとしては、High Level（Service Scopeレベル）でのPotential Volumeの取り纏めが必要。

→POR/DELレベルだとData Quality等の問題があると理解するので、これをBypassしつつ先方の依頼を満たす方法があるかの確認が必要かと。

2\) CVAからのデータのRetrievalについても必要と。

→こちらもData Qualityがネックとなっていると理解するものの、GKAのData

Qualityは担保できているというのが先方の立場。GKAについてのみ対応することは可能？

この議論のポイントは、GKA顧客のみでData

Qualityが担保されている部分をベースにして対応が可能かどうか。そもそもの立脚点が違う場合は、ご指摘下さい。

3\) RPS作成後、Sales担当者の入力が完了した（していない）場合にどのようにStatus Checkするかが不明

→Check Inしていないので、現在のStatus

Checkの範疇の外側にあるという理解。その上でStatusをCheckする方法を理解していないようなので、この部分についてHow

toを伝授する必要あり。そのうえで、よりVisibleにできる仕掛けができるのであれば検討をお願いしたい。

4\) RPSの作成タイミングについて

→日本及びNA顧客については別タイミングでの作成と理解しているが、どの顧客がどのタイミングかの分類が理解できていないようなので（若干混乱あり）、分かりやすい資料及び、顧客ごとの作成タイミングが分かる様な仕掛けがあると、この問題はクリアできるかと。

5\) UATへの参画

→UATへの参画を打診されていなかったとの由（以前は入っていたが）。何れにせよユーザーには違いないので、漏れがないようにしておいた方が良いと思料。若し、参加させたくない理由があるのであれば、それはそれで背景を確認しておきたいです。

\*Check In\*

6\) SequenceのNumberingについて、Eagle X側で問題があるとの指摘。

→詳細については、資料を参照する必要があり。何れにせよ、何かしらの問題があるのであれば、プロセスのレビュー等が必要。

\*Conversion\*

7\) NestleのケースでSystem Performanceの問題があり、Stuckした点について言及あり

→別途、寺田さんに照会させて頂き、複合的な要因があるものの、データ量が多いことを起因としたPerformanceの低下については、直近Solutionsを投入済みということで解決できると理解しております。一方で、OMMCの作業が遅いことも要因となっており、この部分については無駄な（効率が低い）チェックはPerformanceを下げるだけなので、どこをCheckすべきかについて、早急にOMMC側への指導が必要化と思料。必要に応じて、CSTのサポートも検討したほうが良いかもしれません。別途、福田さんには橋から端まで確認していたは、いつまで経ってもTurntimeが良化しないので、プロセスのReviewを見直して頂くようにお願いしておりますが、OMMCはHKG

Tender Supportが精度100％を謳っているので、これに引きずられているようです。

\*Pricing\*

8\) Surchargeの問題が多発しており、そのCheckにResourceを相当程度掛けており、Sustainableでない

→これは、PricerのFamilizaitionの問題及び、そもそも論としてPricerのPerformanceが高くない（これはEagle

X云々ではなく、以前からの問題が単純に顕在化しただけという意味で）と考えられるが、何れにせよ問題は問題なので、以下の対策を検討できるか、ご意見頂けますでしょうか？

a :

OMMCから1－2名程度のPricing経験者を供出頂いて、Volumeが多いLaneについて並行してCheckを掛けるスキームを導入。橋から橋まで見る必要はないが（Hondaのケースはちょいとそれでも難しいかもしれないが）、顧客からの元ネタと入力状況を確認するステップを導入。矢張り、入力者と確認者は別の方がQualityが上がるのではないかと。運賃で間違える可能性は排除できないが、最もRiskが高いのはSurchargeの設定及び、表示方法、更にはFreetimeあたりだと思われるので、このあたりをCheckできる仕掛けを導入出来ないか検討できれば、と思います。全ては必要ないので、GKA及びRKAあたりでなんとか対応できれば、と思います。

b : 既に幾つかのKnown Caseが発見できていると思いますので、Pricer向けにLesson

Learnedということで情宣活動を行う。詳細でなくとも、間違いがよく見つかる機能の使い方（Surchargeの表示の仕方等）があれば、多少なりともPotential

Mistakesが減る可能性がありますので。

\*Minimum Daysの設定\*

9\) Checkに時間を注ぎたいが、Conversion及びSales

Checkにあまり余裕がないので実態は10日を超えることが多くSustainableでないと

→Sales

Checkにそこまで時間が掛かるのは不明ではあるが、現状5日をPricingに充てがっている点が他の作業の余裕をなくしている点もあるかと思われるので、なんとかこの部分について短縮化を図る事ができないか、を検討させて下さい。実際には5日掛けているというよりは、単純に置きっぱなしにしている可能性もあり、その場合はLead

Timeを取る意味合いがないので、その場合は短縮化した上で、上述のCheck Processに日数を割ければQualityも上がるのではないかと思料。

道田

Thanks for the file

If I have read it right then these are the GKA that have conversion already

\- whether it be 2024 or 2025 tender file conversion i.e. at least one

version exists of the potential and i conclude that only 3 x GKA BCO Group

Customers do not have Potential converted yet:

Those are DAIMLER TRUCK \+ H\&M \+ PROCTER & GAMBLE

(Pls note H\&M is being removed from GKA so not so important to determine

yet)

Meanwhile do we know the conversion date / plan for Daimler and Proctor ?

Thanks

Hi Masuda san

Thanks for confirming the pending GKA conversions have workable files.

My own analysis was manual and based on whether we already have a potential

captured

I simply used either 2024 or 2025 volume potential columns

If there was a TEU figure present I deemed the Group Customer as having a

conversion done already.  If it was blank or N/A i deemed it as pending

Good to know however that the pending are workable formats so we will

eventually capture it

Not sure if we yet know when the pending GKA will be converted ?

Hi Siva / Team,

This is different from delegated or common mailboxes, though this works

like a delegated mailbox since a user has to be added.  Once a user is

added, he/she will have access to the email. This new group email already

has a subscription to "Email", meaning all users who are in this group will

also receive the same email in their personal account. If you noticed, your

name (and MK and the rest) was not in the receiver list but you still got

this email.

Further, 2FA is not required once it's "delegated"

Dear All,

Please note GHQ Eagle X team has now incorporated \*FY25 TPT / AET / IET

Products' routings\* into Eagle X Pricing Tool \*effective today\*.

   \- \*Routings details\*: Eagle X E2E Route is in line with the latest TT

   Tool prepared by GHQ DYM PRD. Hence, if Pricers select the new product

   basis routing, CST / TST teams can automatically capture TT information

   based on the latest TT tool.  There will only be a COGH products version

   released now (Suez version has been dropped for now).

   \- \*Costs\*: costs data for the new routings has been prepared for the

   pricing purposes. Due to system constraints (60day ahead rule), GHQ Eagle X

   team prepared PriSim data for pricing purposes by applying historical

   average cost. Due to the earlier product commencement, the latest PriSim

   data covers new routes under IET hence there was no need to prepare

   in-house PriSim data for IET. IET can select new services (including cost)

   in the pricing tool already. TPT/AET: considering New Services for Domi

   legs commence from / after CNY, we should be able to capture new routes

   from next month's PriSim data. In the meanwhile we will need to maintain

   our in-house data for Non Domi for the time being.

TAT product finalisation is on-going so we will keep you posted on when new

product routings will be available once fixed (please see my emails dated

29th Oct below for detailed process overview).

Thank you for your on-going support to Eagle X & to GHQ Eagle X/PRD teams

for their hard work to get new product routings/costing finalised.

For any further questions, please contact \*EUA Eagle X Team group email

address\* \- please do not reply to all.

## CLVリソースへの追加サポート依頼

受信: Wed Nov 06 2024 22:20:49 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Shogo Otsuka \<shogo.otsuka@one-line.com\>  
仲井さん、

(cc：道田さん、神原さん、増田さん）

お疲れ様です。

唐突に恐縮ですが一点お願いがございましてご連絡させて頂きました。

田村さんにサポートいただいているMRG tool作成業務についてなのですが、Ying En（Sick

leaveと伺ってますが大丈夫でしょうか。。）からの業務の早期シフトを行っている中で、少し別の形でやはり一定のリソース補填が必要という状況が発生しており、道田さん、神原さんともご相談させて頂きまして、現在Eagle

Xで活用されているCLVのリソースを援用させて頂く方向でサポートを確保したい考えております。

業務シフトのイメージとしては、今までYing

Enがやってくれていたことを田村さんに丸々担当頂き、それ以外の外注可能なCodeのお越しであったりツールの修正などをCLVにやってもらうようなイメージで、以下が田村さんに伺った追加依頼内容の大枠です。

///////////////////////

・VBAを用いたMRG Toolの保守・開発

・Tool 内のSummary viewの作成や別エクセルへの抽出機能の実装をお願いしたい

・レートのデータ抽出周りを田村さん、ビューやその他の付随機能作成をCLVの役割分担想定

・Workloadは週３\~４時間程度見込めば十分か

///////////////////////

業務内容的にはShort MRG Tool作成の一環ではあるのですが道田さんとご相談の上で既存Eagle

Xチャンネルでのご依頼とすることで速やかにリソース確保につなげたほうが良かろうというアドバイスも頂きまして、お手数ながらCLVに対してリソース依頼のご一報を頂けるとありがたく存じます。

別途上述の内容を田村さんの方に英文依頼用にしたためて頂くようお願いさせていただいておりますので、そちらができ上がり次第お手数ながらCLVに対し打診を頂けないかと勝手ながら考えております。

お忙しいところ恐縮ですが、ご異存なければ本件サポートいただけますと幸いです。

ご不明な点等ございましたらなんなりとお問い合わせください。

大塚さん

ご連絡ありがとうございます。

現在、CLVのメンバーがサポートしてくれているのは、主にConversion toolの保守(GAS) / Game Plan (Simulation

Sheet : GAS)の開発フォローとなっております。

Pricing toolの部分はYing Enがメインで開発をしており、LT MRG含めPricingの部分は全く触れておりません。

したがいまして、CLVもあまりクリアなイメージをもっていないかも知れませんので、大塚さんまたは田村さんからご説明が必要かと思料致します。

来週からCLVも夜勤対応が始まる事に伴い、Eagle Xに携わるCLVのheadcountが５名増える(QA 1名＋Developer 4名)予定です。

テクニカルスキル（VBA対応可能かどうか）については把握しておりませんが、追加されるメンバーのリソースを使えるかも知れません。

当方、増田さんで打診は可能ですが、CLVメンバーにお願いしたい事をご説明頂く場を設定した方が良いかと。

増田さん

田村さんの方で準備されているものが完了したら、Neoに一度打診お願いできればと存じます。

承知しました。次回のCLV ManagementとのTouch pointで聞いてみます。

ただ、CLVの開発メンバーのスキルセット（GAS）的には、若干やりづらい気がしています。

GASはJava Scriptベースですが、VBAはVIsual Basicsで結構書き方が異なるので。

今後、我々から委託するツールをGASで統一して、そこの保守をCLVに統一化するか、

VBAの保守要員も長期的な目線（例えばPricing tool）を含めてCLVで別に抱えるかを考えたほうがいいかと思いました。

よろしくお願い致します。

仲井さん、増田さん、

早速のお返事、ご対応頂きありがとうございます。

英文でのRequirementのサマリーは田村さんに別途進めていただいておりますので、でき次第お手元にご共有頂けるかと存じます。

増田さんにご指摘頂いた部分ですが、MRG

toolも将来的にはGAS化を検討はしているのですが、仰るとおり現状VBAですので、たしかにそのミスマッチについてはCLVとも合わせる必要がありますね。その意味では１つ目のツールをすべてGASで統一して依頼、という選択肢は現状ないため、２つ目のVBA対応もスコープに見据えた形でCLVとしてサポートしうるかというアプローチで一旦打診、ヒアリング頂けますと幸いです。

同ミスマッチがCLVのリソースと能力的にいかんとも解消しがたいということであれば無理に押し込むのではなく別のリソース元やアプローチを考えるべきだと思いますので、その際は改めてご相談させて頂きたく存じます。

お忙しいところ恐縮ですが、よろしくお願いいたします。

本件ご確認いただきありがとうございます。

依頼文について遅くなり申し訳ありません。

簡単ですが下記にてドラフトいたしました。不明点、不足点等ございましたらご連絡いただけますと幸いです。

また、現在TPマケにトライアルを行ってもらっているツールも添付しています。併せてご参照ください。

//

We are creating another pricing tool for cargo out of Eagle-X scope.

We have completed the creation of a prototype for a trade and the prototype

is currently under UAT.

At the same time, expansion of the scope of the trade is under study and we

would like to seek assistance from CLV.

The concept of the tool is basically the same as the Pricing tool from

Eagle-X though it is much simpler.

Function for the rates is and will be developed by GHQ side and we would

like CLV to assist on visualazation part.

More specifically, we want CLV to create summary view to cater to the

format each trade prefers.

The attached is the first prototype for TP trade Dry cargo.

In the sheet nemed "Summary", the proposed rates calculated in "Tiger(MRG

main)" is summarized based on requests from Marketing.

Our request will be 1\. to retrieve the rate data from the rate calculation

sheet and summarize 2\. to convert formats of the naming to requested format

(for example, USLAX to Los Angeles) 3\. to adjust the format including cell

colour, letter colour/size etc... and map them in summary sheet through our

development process.

If you have any question, please let us know.

Thank you

//

以上よろしくお願いいたします。

Hello EagleX Team,

We received a bid file that has some lanes NA is not interested in. I

filtered them out and it has been brought to my attention that I will need

to make a request to not quote these lanes.

In the attached file, please do not quote the lanes that do not touch North

America.

Thank you

## Tender TST Future Schedule

受信: Fri Nov 08 2024 17:39:58 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Pedro Retes \<pedro.retes@one-line.com\>  
Dear Masuda-san and Nakai-san,

Following our discussion last Wednesday, we’ve simulated TST scheduling

from December 2024 through March 2025, typically our peak period. Please

find the summary below. For the simulation, we considered future team

capacity, the Tender calendar, and the current EU rule (which we understand

remains in effect until the end of December 2024). Accordingly, we’ve

outlined two scenarios: the first follows the current Conversion Study

results, and the second applies EUA rules.

Additionally, we expect to close on 4 new hires (2 already onboarded) and

are actively recruiting in HYD to backfill 8 members who have recently

resigned. Depending on their learning curve \- these new hires can be used

for Conversion process of TST Tenders by then.

For further details, including the requested shift schedule, please see the

link below. (\*Note: Still waiting for CST shift schedule to be shared by

Nikko\*)

TST Tender Calendar \- Peak Season

(\*Adding Tsunematsu-san as well\*)

A. \*Original Process \- Current Conversion Study\*

   \- \*Impact of Team Attrition\*:

   A total of 41 Eagle X Tenders will need to be reallocated among the

   remaining team members.

   \- \*Reallocation Feasibility\*:

   If re-allocating to OMMC, with a preference for Asia Tenders, only 2

   Tenders can realistically be shifted.

   \- \*Conclusion\*:

   TST India may be unable to manage all Tenders on time without additional

   support from CST.

B. \*Amended Process \- EUA Rules Applied\*

   \- \*Impact of Team Attrition\*:

   33% of the identified Eagle X Tenders will be processed in their

   original customer format (AS-IS), reducing the Eagle X workload by 33%.

   \- \*Reallocation Requirements\*:

   A total of 24 Eagle X Tenders will need to be redistributed among the

   remaining team members.

   \- \*Conclusion\*:

   TST India is positioned to handle all Tenders without additional support.

IN tender team, and Eagle-X team,

We found a critical issue regarding this bid R2 consolidated file, and

would like your investigation into how this happened.

I assume this specific bid was consolidated by IN Tender team instead of

CST team,

but we found discrepancies between what TPEB NA Marketing submitted through

the Eagle-X pricing tool vs your final consolidation file.

For example, please find the following 3 lanes, under the section "(e)

Destination Haulage" (column AY through BB) we are missing the figures

which ended up with offering significantly low rates to those lanes...

These are just a few examples, but the customer brought up multiple issues

in this consolidated file.

Please reconfirm the root cause and let us know in case that's coming from

the pricer side.

Dear Kosuke San,

We identified discrepancies during the final consolidation using Eagle X,

specifically:

1\. Currency discrepancy for Hong Kong (attached screenshot for reference)

2\. Negative base rate values for certain lanes (screenshot also attached)

To avoid confusion and meet the customer deadline, we considered only the

base rate and updated the customer sheet accordingly.

Please review the attached screenshots for details.

Thanks, and can I also understand that the same thing happened to those 3

examples I shared with you?

The bottom line is that we simply need the pure copy of our pricer's

submission in the final consolidated file.

If you are saying that you didn't do it right because of the time

constraint(deadline was tight) that needs to be rectified.

Flourance and GCSM team,

Can you also make sure this consolidation process is appropriately done by

the tender team?

Hi Masuda-san,

I have checked this based on the shared folder and same with Flourance

findings, it has been captured correctly in Pricer Submission, 50-1 and

60-1.

And I'm trying to search the Email Submission from WNS IN but seems I can

not find it from my mails.

I coordinated now with Murali and Feroz to share with me the E-mail.

Once I get it I need to confirm data with the Customer reconversion File

(the copy and paste file) to check if the they have transferred the Data

correctly back to the Original Customer File.

Will let you know

Nakai san,

We also investigated but there was no tool issue in the tool. Consolidation

tool correctly captured the data.

However, when WNS IN copy & paste to the original file, I believe they

manipulated the data based on their decision.

I think that's not the Eagle X process but they did that as a tender

management process.

but can we at least update our TPEB portion per Peter's submission so that

we can submit within US time today?

This is a US contracted account, and we all should be following based on

what NA side is leading.

@Michelle Vo \<michelle.vo@one-line.com\>

Please coordinate well at your Sales side as well, it seems like our AE

trade is pending and that is causing the delay in our finalization of the

bid.

Regards,

Kosuke OMORI

Sr. Manager, Import Execution Marketing BCO

Dear IN Tender Team,

Good evening.

Please refer to my comments regarding the three related non-TP trades.

I have attached the email evidence for your reference.

\*AET WB:\*

Please adjust the following two routes only:

\- CNSHA and CNNGB to FRLEH and NLRTM \- USD 1,630 / 2,750 per 20' / 40'.

\*IAA:\*

The pricer should maintain the original price.

\*LAEC:\*

This is likely a significant win for the awards portion. Please ensure that

updates are made according to the attached file.

Thank you.

## A/C CERDIA INTERNATIONAL Conversion Challenges

受信: Thu Nov 07 2024 12:07:02 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Benhur Dalumpines \<benhur.dalumpines@one-line.com\>  
\*Dear WNS IN Colleagues,\*

Good day\!

Thank you very much for your support for the \*CERDIA\* Tender.

Just would like to share with you some feedback for this tender and would

appreciate your insight and comments.

As per checking, during Sales Review CKAM has provided some instructions in

the comments portion, however seems some items are not considered into the

conversion tool.

Kindly refer to below items for your perusal, Item 1 is our major concern.

\*1. Sales Instruction:- \* \*Please use code for Freiburg "DEFBG" instead of

DE76C. (Mapping)\*

    As per checking, it seems code was not updated into the Location

Mapping.

   May we know any reason for this misout? Any Challenges?

   Appreciate your suggestion on how we can avoid such cases in future

tenders.

\*2. Sales Instruction:- \* Kindly note that CY-CY (Port to Port) rate is

requested from Pricers.

   Not sure if you have a separate discussion with CKAM on this part, but

as per checking, seems 2 Door Locations are tag as Door

   May we know the background on this one.

  \[image: image.png\]

\*3. For the POD Portion,\* believe below input is not correct:

   Kindly verify:

Appreciate your comments.

Thank you very much.

Hi Analynne,

Per our chat, let's jump on a call today to touch base.

I am still pending some responses from Costco before we proceed and also I

am still reviewing all of the tender RFP files and RFI files and

instructions.

I hope I can finalize this by tomorrow but it also depends on Costco's

responsiveness.

thank you\!

heidi

tenders that have multiple rfp files with potentially different

terms/instructions for each.

Heidi \- This was just one example of particular instructions for a specific

tender.  Please be cautioned that you cannot assume the same as last year.

In fact, it's slightly different this year and not based on the

transportation terms but instead based on whether or not the "round 1"

column has a Y or blank input by Costco which I am confirming how they

would like us to handle the blanks.

Heidi \- this is my first time using eagle-x for a bid.  Checking it quickly

just now, it didn't really do anything with option 1 .   It seems like the

next step is for me to fill out the T\&C summary tab which of course is very

similar to the previous manual format.  Is it possible to add rows ? For

example I may want to add rows to distinguish between different terms for

each destination bid file.

\[image: image.png\]

I tested adding a row and it seemed to work. This will not mess up the

process in eagle-x or on your end will it?

 \*GTM (2) : As per our knowledge, the number of rows has been identified

Analynne and Mychaela,

It was great talking to you just now.

Please note our updated call outs for the Costco bid per our conversation:

Tender Guidance

ALL Round 1 column

instruction:

\*  If "Round 1" column is YES, then we quote rates/service info in Round

1\.

\* If "Round 1" column is BLANK, we will not submit rates or routes/service

in R1 (which means that you shouldn't send these to the pricers yet).  We

will see these lanes again in R2 for our quotation.

ALL "Special Instruction" :  this is NOT to be used as a catch all to input

exceptions or counters  for pricers. They must follow the bid instructions.

ALL  No counters allowed.   Exception is TAWB but these must be clearly

highlighted to OMMC/GAM (Example: quote Felixstowe as SOU or London Gateway)

ALL RFI:  Heidi is reviewing with lead pricers

ALL All transit and route info should be input according to pricer's

"Primary Carrier Service".   The "Primary Carrier Alternative Service" is

simply Costco asking ONE what is the backup service but this service should

NOT be used to calculate transit, etc.     Only need to push pricers for US

and CA inbound if ALTERNATE is missing. HAWAII no need to push as there is

only 1 service.

ALL You're including the SHIPMENT TERM (FOB, FCA, EXW) in the eagle-x file,

correct?  Pricing is dependent on this term

ALL Free Time Files:  please release to the lead trade.   US/CA \- TPEB;  MX

\- LAWC EB    ; JP/KR/TW/CN \- TPWB Dry/Reefer; AU/NZ \- OCE SB ;  UK \- AETWB

/ TAEB. OMMC will send via email to lead trades only. Will then send to all

trades upon completion .

US/CA Place of Receipt SHENZHEN PORTS \= Yantian

US Place of Delivery BELLEVILLE \=VAN BUREN, MI

US Place of Delivery GOULDSBORO \=Covington Township, PA

US/CA "Inland Transit Time (3) Port Of Discharge To Final Destination" :

Heidi will advise the transit to input here

UK/TW/MX Place of Receipt SHENZHEN PORTS \= ONE's direct South china port of

call should be input by the pricer in the load port column. This will be

considered ONE's  CY Place of Receipt. This is a pricer decision; this is

not an OMMC decision

CA/MX We already talked about the "REQUESTED DISCHARGE PORT" which gives

Costco CA multiple options. Copy it over to the pricer discharge port entry

as they must quote the same

AU Place of Delivery shows a DOOR location, yet Costco is asking for a PORT

destination quote. Pricers should indicate our "Place of Delivery" CY in

the "discharge port" column

PENDING QUESTIONS WITH COSTCO:

Tender Comments

MX PENDING \- MX: What is the intention of a Grupo Logistics: 426 Logistic

Dr, Laredo, TX, 78045 noted as Place of delivery yet it's set up as a DOOR

term with a final campus at TEPEJI DEL RIO, HIDALGO?    NOV 4th: still

pending. Will not include in eagle-x for now

ALL Location discrepancies:   Country issues found by Mychaela and Location

City issues found by Yuki

## Costco Bid Launch: \[LIVE\] Initial Check-in\_FY25

受信: Tue Nov 05 2024 16:34:42 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Analynne Garcia \<analynne.garcia@one-line.com\>  
Dear Ben / Masuda san,

As discussed in our meeting this afternoon, please assist to confirm the

following points:

1\. Costco has released a total of 10 files but we have already merged into

a single worksheet only. Total number of requested lanes is 11,631. Instruction

from CKAM is to release those

     lanes that will be quoted only and these are consists of 2,857 lanes

only.

     Can you please confirm if this is feasible?

     \*PENDING FROM GTM : As requested, will share with you the number of

lanes requested by Costco while R1 is being processed.\*

   \[image: image.png\]

2\. For the freetime, the request from CKAM is to release via AS IS format.

FYI, afterwards, this will be sent to all the pricer's involved for their

reference as well.

    Appreciate your comments on this matter.

3\. Based on our observation / experience, this account is frequently

sending additional lanes of request / amendments on some locations

originally requested while R1 is still ongoing.

    In view of this, can Eagle-X can accommodate this kind of request

without going back to the re-mapping process?

4\. At the same time, there are still a few lists of locations that are

still pending on Costco's review.

    We are just worried that once they have confirmed and the bid was

already released to the pricers, there will be an adjustment of the

location and trade mapping.

    How should we deal with this?

We hope to receive your confirmation today if we are fine uploading those

lanes to be quoted only and by today will be able to submit our conversion for

GHQ's review.

FYI, based on the timeline, we should be releasing this bid by Nov 6, 2024\.

Analynne and Mychaela

As info, Costco may release a revised UK destination tender to the CY

only.

I'm not sure if this will come in R1 or R2 but we need to be prepared for

how to handle it if it is changed in R1.  Well noted your questions to the

eagle-x team about this point below.

Thank you\!

Heidi,

As per the confirmation from the Eagle-X team, if there will be additional

lanes during R1 and lanes involved are minimal only, this can still be

accommodated thru Eagle-X.

Should there be challenges that will be encountered, this can be further

discussed.

Hi Masuda san,

Please be advised that we have received a heads up from the CKAM that there

will be changes in the UK market.

From there, we can see and test on how this can be made in Eagle-X once a

bid is released to the pricer and revisions are needed based on customer's

update.

## Eagle X FY24-25 Tender Season Roll \- temporary update on Eagle X scope

受信: Wed Oct 30 2024 22:21:37 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Kasia Stannard \<kasia.stannard@one-line.com\>  
Dear EUA Country Heads,

Dear EUA Sales Heads,

Dear C-KAMs,

Please note that EUA Eagle X team (myself, Adam) had an alignment session

with RHQ M\&C Management (Stanley, Grant) as well as GHQ Eagle X

stakeholders & we agreed the following \*temporary change in Eagle X scope\*:

   \- We will proceed with \*AS-IS tender process\* for \*accounts handled by

   WNS India \*(so called offshore accounts) with \*less than 10 working days\*

    \*lead time\* between receipt date and 1st round deadline, and we will

   proceed Eagle X for those with more than 10 working days (our estimate is

   that more than half of WNS India accounts will be AS-IS)

   \- However, even for those accounts EUA Sales are required to \*fill in

   the Initial Check In\* and then WNS India will proceed to the AS-IS

   process considering the deadline

   \- For R2 onwards, if R1 is done in Eagle X, it is preferable to continue

   Eagle X for the following rounds; but if the deadline is very tight, it

   will be As-Is (Case by case)

   \- If R1 is AS-IS, then R2 onwards will also be AS-IS.

   \- The above will be applied \*until the end of December'24\*. It will be

   reviewed from January'25 based on the situation in WNS India.

   \- Note to EUA Sales on the downstream impact in case bid is processed

   via AS-IS process: \*proceeding with AS-IS means that Award / Filing

   cannot be done through Eagle X process\*, i.e. Sales must manually input

   the CVA and OPUS Filing template as before.

   \- Where to find the list of accounts handled via WNS India \- via Eagle X

   Portal

   \<https://sites.google.com/one-line.com/eaglex/dashboard?authuser=0\> EUA

   Status List

   \- No change to the process for the accounts handled via OMMC

   (TST/offshore accounts) & WNS MNL (CST \- onshore accounts) where minimum

   lead time required for R1 is 5 working days

We believe that this change will enable various stakeholders to get more

familiar with the process & upskill further while meeting customers

submissions deadline and maintaining EUA commitment to Eagle X process.

Thank you for your on-going support to Eagle X & helping us fine-tune the

process in the transition period.

EUA Eagle X team

Thank you.

Hi WNS India team,

As for EUA accounts (not applicable to other regions), you can follow the

guideline which we agreed with EUA and our management.

Please continue Eagle X for on-going tenders but start this direction with

an EUA account that has newly received an Initial Check In.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

   \- For R2 onwards, if R1 is done in Eagle X, it is preferable to continue

   Eagle X for the following rounds; but if the deadline is very tight, it

   will be As-Is (Case by case)

   \- If R1 is AS-IS, then R2 onwards will also be AS-IS.

   \- The above will be applied \*until the end of December'24\*. It will be

   reviewed from January'25 based on the situation in WNS India.

   \- Note to EUA Sales on the downstream impact in case bid is processed

   via AS-IS process: \*proceeding with AS-IS means that Award / Filing

   cannot be done through Eagle X process\*, i.e. Sales must manually input

   the CVA and OPUS Filing template as before.

   \- No change to the process for the accounts handled via OMMC

   (TST/offshore accounts) & WNS MNL (CST \- onshore accounts) where minimum

   lead time required for R1 is 5 working days

We believe that this change will enable various stakeholders to get more

familiar with the process & upskill further while meeting customers

submissions deadline and maintaining EUA commitment to Eagle X process.

Dear CST

Sales found that the POR / POD information was switched due to complicated

customer format. (Horizontal location is POR i/o POD)

・Location Mapping : No impact, sales will submit Location information

through Sales Review.

・Trade : POR / POD should be the opposite, so sales will NOT submit this

part.

・In conclusion, this format will be UNWORKABLE format. So, sales will shift

to Simplified Format.

Is it possible to start creating Game Plan with correct POR (JPNGO,JPUKB

only) \- POD (column C) with the submitted Location code?

## Re: FY25 1st GKA via Eagle X \- Tetra Laval bid

受信: Tue Oct 29 2024 17:27:10 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Daisuke Tsunematsu \<daisuke.tsunematsu@one-line.com\>  
Masuda san,

Kindly be informed that R2 of Tetra Laval is going to be released today or

tomorrow, according to our latest communication with C-KAM.

Before starting R2 of the tender, I would like to make sure of the process

flow & data flow bridging from R1 to R2.

(Background)

In R1 of Tetra Laval, GCSM detected the situation that Pricers were not

familiar enough with manipulation of surcharge (eg.BAF) handling in Pricing

Tool, therefore GCSM pointed the issues out to the respective Pricers and

asked them to ensure that rates populated in the customer's tender sheet is

in line with the ones Pricers really intended to quote.

After that, we observed that some Pricers amended the rates directly in the

customer's tender sheet (instead of Pricing Tool).  Please refer to the

example in the screenshots below.

In this situation, I would like to clarify the following points for R2

execution.

\- I assume that the R1 rates which Pricer originally inputted in Pricing

Tool "before" Pricer's amendment in Customer's Sheet will be carried out to

R2 in Pricing Tool, is my understanding correct?

\- If that is the case, what is the SOP for Pricers to identify the gaps and

ensure their recognition of the correct rates for R2 pricing?

\*Pricing Tool (Tetra Laval R1)\*

(For instance) Base Rate 20' for IDJKT-ARBUE was inputted as \*$4,950

including BAF\*

\[image: image.png\]

\*Customer's tender sheet (Tetra Laval R1)\*

(For the same example) After Pricer's amendment, Rate 20' for IDJKT-ARBUE

was corrected to \*$4,850 sub to BAF\*

Masuda san & Flourance,

Sorry, I would like to update here that R2 of Tetra Laval has been released

a few minutes ago.

According to our quick check :-

\- 32 pricers are involved for 2,357 lanes

\- The external deadline is set on 7 Nov.

\- Submission is via Portal.

The given timeline for R2 is 8 working days (including today) vs 10 days as

per the agreed guideline.

As discussed previously for handling such exceptional cases, GCSM would

like to ask for your decision whether R2 of Tetra Laval should be processed

with Eagle X or Manual handling.

## Re: FY25 1st GKA via Eagle X \- Tetra Laval bid

受信: Tue Oct 29 2024 20:04:42 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Flourance Tan \<flourance.tan@one-line.com\>  
Tsunematsu san,

Thank you for your email.

Speaking from Pricers perspective as well as from Eagle X Pricing

perspective, the below image of Base Rate and OBS (TL BAF) quantum are

correctly reflecting Pricers Intention as per TC Summary.

Please allow me to share with you the pricing consideration / operation and

also highlight the expected confusion point.

As per TC Summary

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kgbsAxgmm\_tocDhsPUvMxGcfxk8SwUZ9GXajFTUuKG0/edit?gid=419768732\#gid=419768732\>

"ONE" AGREED INSTRUCTION TO PRICING,

At the same time, Pricers are aware of Tetra Laval BAF Formula.

\[image: image.png\]

Based on TC Summary, Pricers executed pricing operations and offered, e..g

IDJKT-ARBUE at Base Rate USD 4950/5200/5200 including TL BAF USD

100/200/200. The same Pricers offer was exported to Customer Sheet, Ocean

Freight USD 4950/20' including TL BAF USD 100/20'.

\[image: image.png\]

\*The confusion point arose due to how the reader interprets information

differently. \*

From GCSM perspective, this is read as Ocean Freight USD 4950/20' subject

to TL BAF USD 100/20. GCSM has therefore requested Pricers to make

necessary adjustments. Eagle X Pricing Tool truly reflects Pricers

Intention with Base Rate including TL BAF which Pricers do not wish to

modify, therefore Pricers made the adjustment in Customer Sheet as per

GCSM's.

Further to the above, would like to also share that in fact, such potential

interpretation issue had been well foreseen during Eagle X Review stage,

where Eagle X team highlighted and suggested TST to consider Pricers

Intention whether to offer Subject To, Fixed or Include TL BAF. Whilst TST

confirmed this had been followed accordingly, regret, neither we retrieved

such information in Field Mapping nor received proper instruction on how

information should be input in Customer Sheet via Pricing Request email.

Considering the above, to overcome the confusion for upcoming R2 tender

handling via Eagle X, we would suggest TST adding one additional column to

capture Pricers Intention on TL BAF condition (Subject To, Fixed or Include

TL BAF). At the same time, Eagle X team will remove Include surcharge

quantum (TL BAF in this case) export to Customer Sheet.

Eagle X team will follow up and work closely with TST to stay on track.

Tsunematsu san,

Reference to your latest email, please note Subsequent Round lead time is 7

working days for Offshore tenders. We believe there is no major concern in

proceeding R2 via Eagle X process in addition to my earlier email.

Therefore please quickly trigger R2 Initial Check In within today.

Flourance,

I'm afraid that you might have a wrong understanding of the structure of

the customer tender sheet.

As you understand correctly, the required rate structure is "Base Rate

shall be inclusive of BAF"

However, Pricer is required to input its breakdown in Customer Sheet. As

for 20', Pricer needs to input in Column AP for (Ocean Freight) and Column

AQ for (BAF). And total figures on "all-in" basis are reflected in Column

AW (Total O/F in USD).

In case of IDJKT-ARBUE, if Pricer intends to offer $4,950 (in total of

Base+BAF), he shall input $4,850 in Column AP and $100 in Column AQ. This

is why, Pricer revised his offer in the Customer Sheet as their intention

was $4,950 including BAF.

Would you check it again?

\[image: image.png\]

Besides, kindly be informed that we found that \*108 lanes were added from

R2\*.  Probably another conversion is required to handle those additional

lanes.

Regarding Timeline, 10 days is applied to R2-Tetra Laval as per the

guideline. (pls refer to the calculation logic below)

I will eventually respect your decision to proceed this tender with Eagle

X.   I hope you clarify those concerned points first.

Baseline (for R2)   :  7 days

32 Pricer               : \+ 1 day

2357 lane              : \+ 1 day

Portal                     : \+ 1 day

\=======================

Total                       : 10 days

Tsunematsu san,

Thank you for your message, this is well noted however again this is how

the reader interprets information differently, in addition to missing

instructions on "Pricer is required to input its breakdown in Customer

Sheet".

Ocean Freight could be the same as Total O/F in USD (Base Rate includes TL

BAF) with the breakdown of surcharges shown in columns AQ-AU.

\[image: image.png\]

From Pricers perspective and Eagle X Pricing Tool perspective, this is not

wrong and please avoid concluding that Pricers were not familiar enough

with manipulation of surcharge (eg.BAF) handling in Pricing Tool, or

pricing process was incorrect.

\[image: image.png\]

Nonetheless, we do understand there is a formula in the customer tender

file which sums up Base Rate and various surcharge components to Total O/F

in USD.

Please note the formula is not intact during the conversion process and

therefore resulted in invisibility in Eagle X Pricing Tool. In addition, as

per my earlier email there is insufficient how-to-guide / instruction on

how information should be input in Customer Sheet via Pricing Request email.

To overcome the confusion for R2 tender handling via Eagle X, would you

agree to our suggestion below?

1\. TST adds one additional column to capture Pricers Intention on TL BAF

condition (Subject To, Fixed or Include TL BAF).

2\. Eagle X team removes Include surcharge quantum (TL BAF in this case)

export to Customer Sheet.

3\. (add on) TST adds Remarks for Mapping on rate components sum up to Total

O/F in USD.

4\. (add on) TST shares proper instruction on how information should be

input / reflected in Customer Sheet via Pricing Request email.

Understood R2 Initial Check In has been submitted. Eagle X team will follow

up and work closely with TST to stay on track.

Thanks Flourance,

I didn't say that the formula of Pricing Tool is intact. Our observation

was that Pricers did not use the tool properly.

I agree that some of the issues might come from such wrong interpretation

about the customer's surcharge structure and/or the customer's tender sheet

structure.

In view of very various tender formats and surcharge conditions by

customers, I agree that it's very fundamental for TST to correctly

understand those conditions at least, so that they would be able to provide

guidance to Pricers and verify the data quality after Pricer's submission

properly.

This was another case of R1 Tetra Laval on TPE. (pls refer to the

screenshot below)

Pricer did intend to offer USD6,505 per 20' including OBS \+ CYR.

But the pricing tools' outcome reflected as USD6,505 per 20' \+ BAF (OBS)

USD314 per 20' without CYR.

GCSM pointed out the gap and confirmed that Pricer revised the amount in

Pricing Tool, which was good at least.

In other cases, however, Pricers revised the rates directly in Customer

Sheet outside of Pricing Tool. I'm afraid that such cases would definitely

affect the data quality in R2. For the future, probably we may need to come

up with a measure to monitor or restrict such Pricer's behavior as well.

By the way, would it not be a problem to handle the additional lanes from

R2? (108 lanes added and 5 lanes removed from R2)

Nakai san, Masuda san & Flourance,

 cc Fukuda san (OMMC)

Good morning. Sorry for bothering you while you are on a holiday but this

is urgent.

Would you give us an instruction for Tetra Laval R2?  (either Eagle X or

Manual)

If we follow the agreed guideline of timeline, it indicates "Manual"

because R2 Tetra laval gives us only 7 days (and 2 days has passed already)

vs 10 days as per the guideline.

On the other hand, in view of the concern about the data quality offered in

R1, I'm not sure how much it would impact Pricers to verify the offers made

in R1 if they lose visibility of CM in the tool..

Would you give us your instruction within the morning time?

Otherwise, I will request TST to go ahead with Manual in accordance with

the guideline.

Sorry for the delay. Regret that TST has lost 2 days and cannot meet the 7

day guideline (Maybe next time, we should have a call and conclude

immediately), but if the GCSM feels that the risk is too high, we have no

objection to proceeding with AsIs.

However, recently we have been constantly getting pushback from Pricer on

R2- onward because switching to AsIs from R2 is a huge burden for Pricer.

Please explain this point carefully to Pricer and support them as much as

possible.

Thanks & Regards,

Masuda san,

Thank you for your confirmation. We will instruct TST to go ahead with

Manual.

As I mentioned earlier, the guideline conditionally applicable to R2 Tetra

Laval is 10 days instead of 7 days.

I think that the guideline is important for all the relevant parties

(eg.Sales, Pricers, TST etc) to take actions clearly and accordingly.

Actually the guideline was agreed in June when it was before go-live of

Eagle X.

Therefore, let's review the guideline together "IF" it no longer makes

sense from Eagle X perspective.

Down the line, I hope Eagle X makes sure of implementing the guideline in

place.

Nakai san, Masuda san,

I would like to ask for your instruction either Eagle X or Manual to handle

R3 of Tetra Laval.  Your overnight reply would be appreciated.

\- The previous round (R2) was processed with "Manual" instead of Eagle X

\- We were informed by C-KAM that Tetra Laval started R3 negotiation

yesterday.

\- The external deadline R3 is set on 27 Nov 2024 (6 working days including

today)

\- However, the tender portal is NOT yet open, therefore we are still not

able to check if R3 file is the same as R2.

\- Besides, the customer provided target rates to C-KAM. We are still

checking with C-KAM whether those target rates are included in R3 file or

not.

## Fwd: A/C Honda Motor \- 2025/2026 Tender Preparation Action Items & Deadline

受信: Tue Oct 29 2024 13:57:26 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Daisuke Tsunematsu \<daisuke.tsunematsu@one-line.com\>  
Nakai san, Masuda san,

Data accuracy and timeliness are key factors from the tender management

perspective.

In this respect, I'm a bit concerned about Honda in terms of timeline.

Because, according to the latest information from C-KAM, R1 Honda is to be

released on 01 Nov, and the external deadline is set on 18 Nov, meaning

only 12 working days are given till the submission.

So far, we completed R1 of the two GKA tenders with Eagle X, the first one

was Tetra Laval and the second one was Ford.

According to our observation, the both tenders took 16 working days to

submit R1 offers to the customers against the guideline set at 10++ working

days.

I would like to ask for your guidance :-

\- Sales should proceed with Honda on Eagle X process?

\- If affirmative, do you prepare any backup plans to adhere to the external

deadline at this stage in case that Eagle X may fail to keep the external

deadline?

Tsunematsu san,

Thank you for the heads-up and duly noted the risk.

But I believe without handling the live tenders, OMMC TST team will not be

improved in Eagle X.

(Even though WNS India TST had a lot of mistakes, I would say they are

gradually improving compared to the initial stage)

As long as the deadline has more than our agreed baseline and it is

workable in Eagle X, I would like OMMC to handle it in Live as much as

possible.

But we will carefully support the OMMC team for the conversion and

consolidation to mitigate the time and if we feel there is any risk at the

time of Live conversion, we will switch to As-Is immediately.

Thanks & Regards,

Kazuki Masuda

Also I need min 3 days to check data (rates/TT/Route..etc) and discuss with

MKTG team , if necessary.

Nov 1st : I will receive the Tender Package from Honda and I will do the

initial check

Masuda san,

This is another case in which we need to ask for your quick decision either

Eagle X or Manual, while I agree that TST needs to take more firsthand

experience with live tenders.

Honda will be released tomorrow (01 Nov).  I noticed that the timeline of

Honda would be more tighter than what we originally discussed.

Because C-KAM requests 3 days at least for her verification of all data

after the tender sheet is filled out.

That means, the consolidated file needs to be submitted to C-KAM within 8

working days (on/before 13 Nov) if we cater for her request.   (as OMMC is

closed tomorrow, 01 Nov is not counted in the "8" WD.)

\[image: image.png\]

According to our quick check of the customer's tender sheet used in the

previous year as attached, we identified some complex points in the format

as follows.

From your technical perspective, would you confirm that the format would be

no issues to handle with Eagle X?

   \- Honda BAF is preset at specific amount in different currency (USD or

   JPY) in the customer tender sheet

   \- Surcharge structure (eg.whether THC is incl or excl) is diffetenly

   indicated lane by lane

Tsunematsu san,

ONEJ guideline this year is to proceed via Eagle X fundamentally so we

should start initial check in rather then wasting time through this kind of

communication.

As you mentioned before, understand HKG GCSM doesn’t have accountability to

determine anything. Therefore, if JP SYM has no objection, will handle this

account via Eagle X.

Sales confirmed Initial Check-in can be submitted tomorrow AM which means

there will be 8.5 working days to proceed Eagle X process (conversion to

pricing submission).

Nakai san & Sakuma san,

Thank you for your confirmation. Let's proceed with Eagle X anyway.

Based on Initial Check-In to be done by C-KAM tomorrow, this is the

proposed time schedule after our quick discussion with TST.

In order to keep the deadline, the tender must be released to Pricers \*on 5

Nov at the latest\*.

At least 2 days can be granted to C-KAM for data verification and

clarification with MKTG.

\[image: image.png\]

@Masashi Fukuda \<masashi.fukuda@one-line.com\>

I'm afraid the schedule will become super tight if Conversion cannot start

tomorrow as soon as Initial Check-In is completed by sales.

Although I know it will be an off day in Philippines tomorrow (01 Nov),

would it be possible for OMMC to assign a staff to start conversion

immediately right after Initial Check-In?

@Koji Nakai \<koji.nakai@one-line.com\> @Ai Sakuma \<ai.sakuma@one-line.com\>

In case that we fail to catch 5 Nov for Bid Release, all the downstream

processes would be pushed back, which would possibly sacrifice the time for

C-KAM's data review, or in the worst scenario fail to keep the external

deadline (18 Nov).

I would like to make a consensus with you in advance, whether we should

continue Eagle X (or shift to Manual process as Plan B) in case that BID

release is not completed by EOB Tuesday (5 Nov). I would like to ask for

your guidance.

Best regards,

## Re: Eagle X FY24-25 Tender Season Roll \- interim update on new product details

受信: Fri Oct 25 2024 18:26:25 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Kasia Stannard \<kasia.stannard@one-line.com\>  
Dear All,

As we are receiving increased question on \*new product details\* in Eagle X

tender tools, please allow me to give you an interim update:

   \- GHQ Eagle X team is not the data owner & relies on actions of other

   stakeholders to be completed first (NP, Trade, schedule update team, PRD

   etc)

   \- New ports, dummy PFS, long range schedule details need to be completed

   before any PRD routings can be created for a new product

   \- Only once it's set up, Eagle X team can link new product details to EX

   tools

   \- Please note that timing will depend on the Trade as they are at

   different stages of product finalisation but for AET indicative date is

   early Nov

   \- Until then Pricers & Sales are required to communicate & insert new

   service details manually

   \- We appreciate it's not ideal but GHQ Eagle X team will only be able to

   reflect/simulate new product details in Eagle X pricing tool once received

   from the relevant GHQ stakeholders

For any further questions, please contact \*EUA Eagle X Team group email

address\* \- please do not reply to all.

Kasia, Rebecca \- PIC for Trade questions

Giselle, Adam \- PIC for Sales questions

Thank you.

Hi Kasia,

I have kept everyone in cc because they may be experiencing similar

problems with the current process and I therefore think it would be useful

to have everyone on the same page.

As you rightly noted, several countries have already raised their concerns

\- including me.

That is why I have already contacted GHQ regarding this issue\!

I understand that you are not responsible for the routing updates, but my

first question would be: who is, and who can release additional manpower to

speed up the process?

At this point I have to say it very clearly: We cannot handle a global

tender if we have to enter the new service details manually\!

The source of error increases, which in turn may lead to us not being

considered in the second round of tender.

We lack of resources to do this, nor do we have the knowledge and 24/25

comparability of non-EUA trades.

Therefore, I strongly recommend finalizing the 2025 service details as soon

as possible.

We have just started the first global tenders and will only receive the

bulk in the coming weeks.

EagleX should be a supporting tool that reduces the workload of all parties

involved and not the other way around.

If we cannot offer a comprehensive range of services in the tender, we run

the risk of losing ground with our customers\!

Therefore pls kindly push the respective parties to update the service

details.

Tks and looking forward to further info on the service updates.

Tks and bvrgds

Moritz

Hi Moritz,

All relevant stakeholders are aware of the pressure to finalise new product

details ASAP however please note it’s neither resource nor Eagle X issue

(you will have exactly the same issue if tender was handled old way as

details are simply not kniwn). It’s related to the fact that there is not

enough new product details to create dummy PRD routings. It’s a chain

reaction involving many teams & Eagle X is the last part of the puzzle \-

awaiting on standby.

At the same time please note that new product routing details will not be

created at the same time for all Trades as product development is at

different stages (TAT product has not been announced externally yet).

Regret I cannot give you any more specific information. Saving grace, if

any in this stressful situation, is that for most of EUA bids we are in

early round stage so hopefully by final rounds we will be able to auto

verify routing details using Eagle X tools.

Hej Kasia,

thanks for your further explanation.

Unfortunately, this does not change our situation that we are not able to

update each individual tender manually – the biggest challenge is again

those tenders that are not directly linked to EUA, such as IA.

We have received offers for Jebel Ali, ANR – TYO via SIN, … this

information is available and needs to be updated.

So who is responsible for these updates? And what exactly prevents us from

entering the existing routings into the system? Sorry, maybe I'm too naive

and don't know all the systems in detail, but why do we need to fix

routings as described above if this is already known?

Tks and brgds

Hi Koji,

cc: Masuda san,

Hopefully you will read it after your holidays but I am concerned about EX

teething issues more & more. We discussed it during the Global SYM Meeting

last Thu & Michida san/Kurimoto san listened to our concerns but I didn't

think they were ready to reduce EX scope. Masuda san can update you better.

Part of the issue is that the majority of bids now are EUA so other RHQs

did not raise similar issues \- looking at stats I cannot think how we will

survive Feb. Also Oct seems very busy for EX with GHQ team under huge

pressure \- if that's the case with only 16 bids released (I was expecting

numbers to be higher), then Dec-March should be scary. I know

teams familiarity will increase but we may have new teams coming on-line at

the same time like other Regions Pricers or Sales.

I think something's gotta give at some point.

\[image: image.png\]

I purposefully did not comment on Giles informing us that  'Renault,

Stellantis and Schneider would not be processed via Eagle X as from this

week but dealt with Offshore team directly'.

Thank you.

Dear Giles,

Please allow me to respond first given Nakai san is currently out

of office.

We realise that there are teething issues with Eagle X (perhaps bigger than

anticipated) & same feedback has been escalated last week to the senior M\&C

Mngt during Global SYM Meeting.

Not to confuse the matter please let me split the issue into 2 categories:

   \- \*Eagle X data quality\* \- admittedly there is room for improvement. As

   much as tools improved greatly compared to the last year, given the big

   jump in tender volumes (approx 200 were handled by Ex last year, with a

   target for this year of nearly 1100\) we see data quality

   deterioration which mostly is linked to various team familiarisation. Steps

   being taken to address it:

      \- Refresher sessions have been conducted with EUA

      Pricers beginning of Oct after which we see skills/engagement level

      increasing.

      \- There are 3 offshore teams involved in Eagle X process,

currently counting

      65 FTE. In terms of tool familiarity CST (onshore accounts) is ok,

      TST/WNS IN (offshore/hypercare accounts) require more

attention/practice. At

      least 15 new FTE will be added. GHQ Eagle X team is engaging with the

      teams to educate & upskill further, GHQ EX team members have been

      dispatched to WNS India to supervise & assist on site. OFS team structure

      was adjusted to better fit the tender peak season.

      \- There were some instances where we felt we lost time during the

      tender window as it took too long for GHQ team to confirm conversion

      feasibility \- we requested to set up clear commitment & deadlines so in

      case conversion is not feasible, we don't lose time without a

need. Please

      note that it is mostly the issue for new bids/bids where the tender sheet

      changed as otherwise all last year bids are subject to

pre-conversion study

      with a high success ratio of 90%+.

      \- We requested GHQ EX/Mngt to consider removing some of tenders from

      EX scope for this year with EUA suggestion being big multi-Trade tenders

      involving EUA DR (inlands are one of the problematic areas currently)

      however we have not received any confirmation/decision yet. This is still

      being discussed at GHQ M\&C senior Management level.

   \- \*New Product details \*- NOT Eagle X related:

      \- Please let me highlight that missing details of a new product are

      not EX related so even if you handle some bids via traditional

manner \*via

      offshore, those details will still be missing for now & will have to be

      added manually\*.

      \- Unfortunately this year we have 2 big changes coming at the same

      time: transferring form THEA to PA as well as considerably ramping up the

      amount of tenders handled by Eagle X as per GHQ M\&C instructions

\- but the

      Ex process does not impact/delay finalisation of the new product.

We appreciate ONE FR support to Eagle X (last year & this year) & fully

understand that ONE internal tender process change cannot impact the

quality/timeliness of input towards customers, especially with AET BSA

increasing & 2030 strategy. The results of the recent EUA EX survey

conducted by RHQ Sales will be shared with the GHQ EX team which hopefully

will give them some balanced views of how things are going & what needs to

improve.

We will keep you posted as soon as we receive some feedback from GHQ M\&C

Mngt on Eagle X scope.

Thank you.

Good Morning Grant

\*\*Please clearly specify what are those "Inclusive" Surcharges  and

"Subject to" Surcharges.\*

I. GENERAL RATE REQUIREMENTS :

Rates

In principle a shipping lane consisting of 3 legs and is always door to

door. A shipping lane is divided into 5 buckets, see Figure 6 1:

Leg 1: (A) Origin Inland Haulage, OILH

Leg 2: (B) Origin Terminal Handling, OTHC

(C) Ocean Rates, SFC

(D) Destination Terminal Handling, DTHC

Leg 3: (E) Destination Inland Haulage, DILH

 Figure 6 1: Five Buckets Model

Rates are determined through negotiations between Philips and Carrier.

Infodis calculates rates according the Infodis rate-sheet, which is a

translation of the rates in the MPS files created during the negotiations.

All five bucket rates and the demurrage and detention rates are in the

Infodis rate-sheet. These rates are available per container type. The

Freight Cost Calculation Date (see 6.10), is the date on which the freight

costs are calculated in Infodis.

The container types applicable for Carrier are indicated by an ‘X’ in Table

6 1:

Subject of the present RfQ is all Ocean FCL business with Royal Philips

Total scope is divided into 3 packages that are defined as below:

Standard FCL:  Regular Philips Ocean freight business. Standard FCL will be

most of the total scope

Downstream flows: Direct shipments to customers are required based on

specific requirements for part of the standard FCL flow

Corridor project: Air to Ocean initiative. Direct service only is required

(no transshipping if possible). Speed and reliability are of key

importance. Supplier should quote based on the shortest lead-time

available. Volumes are more volatile than regular business, due to the

nature of this initiative. If the awarded supplier changes service that

impacts routing or lead-time, Philips must be informed and involved at

minimum 1 month in advance, to assess impact. In case of service change,

Philips reserves the right to re-allocate the lane to a more suitable

service.

Volume estimations will be shared for all lanes in scope.

Additional requirements

Door-to-door lanes: Supplier needs to enable Philips to cherry-pick a mix

of services (DD, PD, DP, PP) on all Door-to-Door lanes

Example: Oostrum-NLRTM-USNYC-Mount Pleasant Lane can be booked D-D but also

D-P (Oostrum-NLRTM-USNYC), P-P (NLRTM-USNYC) and P-D (NLRTM-USNYC-Mount

Pleasant).

Cluster ports/ Multi-port: Supplier can freely select the port they are

most confident to provide a competitive offer with reliable service, unless

otherwise specified in lane level requirements of the QST.

Seasonality: A volume forecast is provided per quarter, to allow for

capacity planning based on seasonality. Supplier is requested to follow the

same volume allocation   
trend throughout the year (not linear volume

distribution throughout the year).

RATES MUST BE OFFERED AS FOLLOWS:

ALL-IN BASE RATE SUBJECT to following surcharges only

1.Origin Haulage (if a lane has a door receipt)

2\. THL Origin Terminal Handling

3\. THD Destination Terminal Handling

4\. Destination Haulage (if a lane has a door delivery)

5\. IMO ( DG Charge)

https://shipandbunker.com/prices/av/global/av-g20-global-20-ports-average

3 Jun. 2024 – 23 Aug. 2024 \= $624

Baseline is VLSFO Port average during Jun 3rd ,2024 to Aug 23rd ,2024

Bunker trigger 15 %

VLSFO 20 Port Average during the period of Dec 1, 2024, through Feb 28,

2025, to be compared with Baseline period on Mar 1, 2025, for a potential

adjustment on APR 1, 2025\.

Example: Monitoring Q1 (Bunker VLSFO Dec-Feb –$704) shows an increase

between baseline and current quarter of $92, which means 15% increase from

the baseline.

Delta hit the trigger \- 15%, we do the bunker adjustment \- to calculate the

adjustment we multiply the trade factor (next slide) and delta $92

Asia-Asia as an example, trade factor 0,6 \* $92 (delta) \= $55,2 adjustment

for 40ft and $27,6 for 20ft

The responsibility of the announcement is shared between both parties.

If there are no announcements of the two parties, the freight rate will not

change for the next quarter.

The process works both ways. If bunker will drop under \-15% ocean bucket to

be decreased.

In the next quarter check will be done based on:

VLSFO 20 Port Average during the period of Mar 1, 2025, through May 31,

2025, to be compared with Baseline period on Jun 1, 2025, for a potential

adjustment Jul 1, 2025\.  Baseline rates remain the basis for

increase/decrease rates.

Quarterly review calculation is based on previous quarter’s fuel levels as

baseline\!

\*3\*

\*FREE TIME\*

The second type of additional costs is predetermined additional costs from

Table 6 3\. These demurrage and detention costs can be calculated by Infodis

automatically. Infodis calculates detention and demurrage based upon the

following data:

\*• Demurrage is based on vessel arrival to full out gate date minus free

days.\*

\*• Detention is based on full out gate date to empty equipment returned

date minus free days\*.

The necessary base rates and free days for this calculation are specified

in the Infodis rate-sheet and they are made available in Infodis. Infosys

will review and send the costs for approval to a Philips key user. These

steps are described in Appendix VI.

A pre-bill is created for approved additional costs per involved freight

payer and will be sent to Carrier. The pre-bill creation and delivery

schedules are according to the schedule in section 6.6. Carrier will be

informed in case of not-approved costs. The topic of non-approved

additional costs can be discussed in the Quarterly Business Review Meetings

if the carrier is not agreeable with the result of the approval process.

Unless I have overseen it I cannot find any feedback from the customer.

The Pricing file is empty:

And the 'Allin Rates feedback' shows only the below:

FYI I am referring to sheet: PhilipsHealthtech\_Pricing Tool (EF Domi-AFS) R2

Hello IN TENDER,

Can you please recheck the ROUND 2 date in Eagle X sheet?  Please revert

with the correct sheet and then I can finalise my rate.  Also if there is a

new column, please indicate them as well.

It seems a copy and paste went wrong.  We have missing info and

incorrect information on the column. From column UQ everything is

incorrect, it is not what we had in ROUND 1\.

Not to mess up any formula, please send me a corrected Round 2\.

Hi Nagachiranjeevi,

Please use our round 1 offer submission for round 2\. Once all trade

submissions are consolidated, we will manually update the ocean rate for

lanes we wish to target.

Much like other tenders, the data within EagleX is not totlaly accurate

with D/CY lanes and their associated costs and CM/TEU. As such, we will

maintain the submission and manually adjust the ocean rate.

Also noted interally is that as IOP are offering on pre-carriage we will

focus on the ocean rate with the pick up depot in mind.

@Alexandra Troost \<alexandra.troost@one-line.com\> As per our chat we will

offer per the below screenshot's file (too big to upload into this email)

Once all trade offers are consolidated, we can quickly manually update the

ocean rate.

Dear Eagle X Team,

looking at the R2 sheet against R1 sheet, there is a lot of input missing

from round 1 which should be still there in R2.

Please check the file and revert with a fixed file.

Otherwise I will reduce the rates manually directly in the customer sheet

as we still have multiple deadlines today and ew are under time constraints.

## Tank matrix for Eagle-X /NA NVO export group email

受信: Thu Oct 24 2024 05:06:05 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Sergiy Pavlenko \<sergiy.pavlenko@one-line.com\>  
Hi Eagle X support team,

For the NVO customer bids containing non domi US export dry/tank lanes,

please include na.mktg.nvoexport.pri@one-line.com into distribution since

our team is handling non-domi NVO dry pricing.

Also, there are some tank shippers which only have TK lanes in a bid, and

dry FAK rates are not applicable. Is it possible to add an attached matrix

into Eagle X files for Tanks. Please note, that tool should only pull OFT

portion for tanks and not to combine it with the dry origin/destination

arbs.

If you have any questions please let me know.

Thank you.

## EagleX \- NA Sales Questions/Concerns/Actions Needed

受信: Wed Oct 02 2024 00:38:45 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Zach Connors \<zach.connors@one-line.com\>  
Hi Masuda san / Nakai san / Flourance,

We had a successful rollout and are already live as of today to put all

bids through Eagle X. HOWEVER, we have some very serious questions and

concerns that may hinder our ability to operate smoothly. Please urgently

consider below (\*GSM and DYM marked for who the question is for\*):

1\) \*DYM \*File Upload \- 10MB max for single file and max 10 files

  \- We have several bids where this will be a total conflict, what are we

doing to do?

2\) \*DYM \*Need a place to input bid instructions that are not explicitly

spelled out in customers' files (tender or t\&c)

  \- Suggest a freetext field in an appropriate place for sales to input. We

almost ALWAYS have some commentary aside from the offshore team formal

summary.

3\) \*DYM \*Preemptive mapping for locations to be subbed

  \- This could tie into above \#2, but we often KNOW that certain locations

are confusing in the customers' wording on the bids, sales can explain

upfront if we have a place to do that.

4\) \*DYM \*Different sheets for different trades with totally different Sales

Input \- how to handle???

  \- Some bids will have separate tenders for each major tradelane (Walmart

example), should those all be separate "Seq No"? If so if there are 10 we

just have to do 10 separate seqs?

5\) \*GSM \*How do we reconcile "Gameplan" for GKA/RKA etc

  \- Are we all firmly clear that a \*single Route Portfolio Sim \*will be the

only form of Gameplan required of sales? And then the Initial Check

In/Sales Input \- we still get requests for gameplan from other trades, when

will this go away?

6\) \*GSM \*MUST make sure that GAMs cc RAMs who do price control in the

initial check in

  \- We need to ensure that all Sales who have commercial control are cc in

the initial check in by the GAM, please help

\--

Zach,

Regarding \#5 \*GSM How do we reconcile "Gameplan" for GKA/RKA etc   \- Are we

all firmly clear that a single Route Portfolio Sim will be the only form of

Gameplan required of sales? And then the Initial Check In/Sales Input \- we

still get requests for gameplan from other trades, when will this go away?\*

Yes, we are aligned on that. However, we do not acknowledge that some other

Trade still requests for game plan with such different formats.Would you

mind sharing the cases so that we would be able to review them with SYM

team?

Regarding \*\#6 GSM MUST make sure that GAMs cc RAMs who do price control in

the initial check in   \- We need to ensure that all Sales who have

commercial control are cc in the initial check in by the GAM, please help\*

Yes we agree on this. I will discuss with SYM/DYM how to make sure of it.

Hi Masuda san / Nakai san / Flourance,

We had a successful rollout and are already live as of today to put all

bids through Eagle X. HOWEVER, we have some very serious questions and

concerns that may hinder our ability to operate smoothly. Please urgently

consider below (\*GSM and DYM marked for who the question is for\*):

1\) \*DYM \*File Upload \- 10MB max for single file and max 10 files

  \- We have several bids where this will be a total conflict, what are we

doing to do?

2\) \*DYM \*Need a place to input bid instructions that are not explicitly

spelled out in customers' files (tender or t\&c)

  \- Suggest a freetext field in an appropriate place for sales to input. We

almost ALWAYS have some commentary aside from the offshore team formal

summary.

3\) \*DYM \*Preemptive mapping for locations to be subbed

  \- This could tie into above \#2, but we often KNOW that certain locations

are confusing in the customers' wording on the bids, sales can explain

upfront if we have a place to do that.

4\) \*DYM \*Different sheets for different trades with totally different Sales

Input \- how to handle???

  \- Some bids will have separate tenders for each major tradelane (Walmart

example), should those all be separate "Seq No"? If so if there are 10 we

just have to do 10 separate seqs?

5\) \*GSM \*How do we reconcile "Gameplan" for GKA/RKA etc

  \- Are we all firmly clear that a \*single Route Portfolio Sim \*will be the

only form of Gameplan required of sales? And then the Initial Check

In/Sales Input \- we still get requests for gameplan from other trades, when

will this go away?

6\) \*GSM \*MUST make sure that GAMs cc RAMs who do price control in the

initial check in

  \- We need to ensure that all Sales who have commercial control are cc in

the initial check in by the GAM, please help

\-- 

Best regards,

Initial check-inですが、以下に追加したいSalesのアドレスを入力すれば、以降のやり取りにも全て含まれます。

\[image: image.png\]

また、Game Planの宛先ですが、status listのKey Account Manager (fm Tender

calendar)を設定しています。

ただ、GAMに加えてRAMも加えたい等の場合も想定されますので、今月から\*Game Plan account list\*

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Az\_0bFtNA\_bn71qWbQ1zZ012ED\_hs5fySOSDrhz1XYU/edit?gid=0\#gid=0\>としてTender

release 2ヶ月前に展開し、Sales PICやTender release monthが変わる場合は入力するようにお願いしております。

こちらをアップデートしてもらったアカウントについてはGame Planを展開する際に、関連するSales全てに送ることが可能です。

一方、NAにおいては一斉にRPSを作成し、展開する事が予想されますので、NA用のGame Plan listを作成した方が良いかも知れませんね。

作業自体は同じですが、NAのGame Plan timingとTender release monthは合わないので、常松さん / NA Sales

managementが問題なければ上記で進めるようにします。

一度、Zach / Taraに提案頂ければ幸甚です。

仲井さん、

ご教示いただきありがとうございます。

Game Plan account list のスキームでRelease

MonthやC-KAM等のデータがテンダーの２カ月前に更新されるということであれば、

来期以降にオリジナルのデータソースがTender Calendarから Status List / Tender DBにシフトした後も、

データの更新はStatus List側で行われることになり、テンダーカレンダー上でのマニュアル作業は不要になる、

テンダーカレンダーの更新はStatus List / Tender DB からデータを引っ張ってくればOK,

ということになりますね。

念の為上記理解で合っているかご確認いただけますか？ その前提でGCSM内でも方向性を調整したいと思います。

Best regards,

\*Dear Nakai-san,\*

Allow me to share below insight/comment in blue for conversion side:

1\) \*DYM \*File Upload \- 10MB max for single file and max 10 files

  \- We have several bids where this will be a total conflict, what are we

doing to do?

DYM: For tenders documents beyond the limitation, we can do the below

approach.

1\. In the Initial Check In Google Form, Sales may just attached few files

within the allowable capacity

2\. Once Sales Submitted the Initial Check In, in the Email notification, we

have the URL, Link of the Customer File Folder, Sales can just click that

link and directly drag & drop those other tender files into the shared

folder

\[image: image.png\]

\*For Enhancement:\*

ADD URL in the Google Form \- Initial Check In itself to provide direct link

to the shared "Customer File" Folder in order for SALES to Drag & Drop

those Tender Documents which are unable to upload.

\<Image\>

\[image: image.png\]

2\) \*DYM \*Need a place to input bid instructions that are not explicitly

spelled out in customers' files (tender or t\&c)

  \- Suggest a freetext field in an appropriate place for sales to input. We

almost ALWAYS have some commentary aside from the offshore team formal

summary.

DYM: In the Google Form Initial Check In, we have a field for Sales

Comments / instructions which Sales can utilize for those tender

informations or special instructions which are not indicated in the RFQ

FIle.

We are currently confirming with developer if we have some text limitation

on this field

\[image: image.png\]

3\) \*DYM \*Preemptive mapping for locations to be subbed

  \- This could tie into above \#2, but we often KNOW that certain locations

are confusing in the customers' wording on the bids, sales can explain

upfront if we have a place to do that.

DYM: May we suggest to utilize the above mentioned field in Google Form as

well.

Other possible options: For Standard Accounts (Oshore) Sales may indicate

this information into the T\&C Summary file item 6 or 7

\[image: image.png\]

4\) \*DYM \*Different sheets for different trades with totally different Sales

Input \- how to handle???

  \- Some bids will have separate tenders for each major tradelane (Walmart

example), should those all be separate "Seq No"? If so if there are 10 we

just have to do 10 separate seqs?

DYM: For Multiple Trade with totally different Rate requirements and

different RFQ template for each trade (like Walmart), our best option at

the moment is to release the tender by trade-wise, separately, creating

separate "Seq No" for each trade.

But in case we have trades with similar Requirement and RFQ Templates, then

alternatively we can use Union Tool for those trades to minimize the seq no

creation.

はい、ご理解の通りです。

Status list上にあるデータを使えば、Tender calendarとして別で作業する必要はなくなるはずです。

RKA/LKAが主ですが、Tender calendarの情報を元にGame

Planを展開すると、Sales担当が違うというケースが結構ありましたので、

今期、Eagle Xを通した場合は正しい情報にアップデートされます。

## MOM ONE ID AND EAGLE X 26 AUG

受信: Tue Aug 27 2024 11:54:20 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Jovinianus Erwin \<jovinianus.erwin@one-line.com\>  
Dear Masuda san

CC : All Eagle X team

Thank you for meeting yesterday and kindly find below points that from SKAM

side needs :

1\. Customer segmentation to be shown in Target Account List 25\.

\[image: image.png\]

\*SKAM will need to check on monthly basis on Tender Release Period (

crucial time for CKAM & SKAM to discuss on port pair target for game plan

2025 )\*

2\. If SKAM / Local Trade can not add comment in below Game Plan Discussion,

we will request to CKAM via Sales Force. for target lane that ONE ID needs

as per example

for Toyota Tsusho (

https://one-line.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Event/00UIg000004R4ANMA0/related/AttachedContentDocuments/view?ws=%2Flightning%2Fr%2FAccount%2F0012w00000tR6RgAAK%2Fview

)

\[image: image.png\]

SKAM informed CKAM based on input from shipper ( TTI ) to support for TH

business.

\[image: image.png\]

3\. Visibility for SKAM to view tender progress since some of the files need

access .

\[image: image.png\]

\[image: image.png\]

4\. ID local Potential bid sheet can actually access in RPS since it has

more details on CM and equipment.

\[image: image.png\]

If possible all the information on all accounts can be pulled into 1 single

dashboard for easy checking and sorting based on customer name and country

wise.  This will help all CKAM, SKAM,Trade, Pricer to easily

check based on country wise.

6 . If SKAM can also get a notification for Game Plan based on Sales Force

since SKAM may or may not be aware if tender already starts.

For ID , we can use group email address ( id.keyaccountsales@one-line.com &

id.onecaresales@one-line.com )

\[image: image.png\]

Dear Pak Nugra ,

Kindly advice for additional suggestions for Eagle X team.

Thank you.

Dear Eagle X Team,

From ONE ID ECOM (data statistics) team, allow us to recap the following

\*WISHLIST\* that we raised during the meeting:

\*1. EAGLE X Dashboard of Potential vs Nomination\* (sample here

\<https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/fe473843-119c-45bd-bcca-a57fc46b4ef9/page/p\_fboxoqq2jd\>

\*2. EAGLE X Dashboard of Actual\* vs Nomination\* (sample here

\<https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/b9f57e29-ed74-4c33-bfb6-7a905f8217b9/page/SaRyC\>

)

\*    \- both complete with detail information e.g. Trade, Port Pairs,

Country, Team, and Sales PIC-wise information\*

\*    \- (\*) actual means ALL awarded lanes, not only limited to those who

have AP\*

Currently   : Dashboard only available for Tender progress monitoring (here

\<https://lookerstudio.google.com/embed/u/0/reporting/ac8a4a2c-7ad7-40d6-9ecd-3d43be32fce2/page/CDZiD\>

)

Initial idea : we found that EAGLE X raw data (google sheet) has sufficient

information that makes the Dashboard creation possible

Purpose    : easy monitoring for bidding preparation (e.g. targeting the

non-nominated or low awarded % lanes) & monitor the actual materialization

Thanks

Hi Masuda-san,

Regarding Red bull 2025 tender

1\. The deadline is set on Aug 27 in which only 5 working days are available,

2\. WNS has sent an unworkable email ( as attached) , assuming the tender is

pending Eagle X team review and study is in progress.

Need your confirmation asap to confirm whether to process this account via

Eagle X or as-is process.

Hi Masuda san,

To supplement, found Red Bull is wrongly shown as "Standard" and handled by

CST in the \[TEST\] Status List FY25, but it should be "Hypercare" handled by

WNS.

Besides, don't know why below tagging mentioned "No Tender Sheet" while

it's mentioned there're 5 bid sheets in the unworkable email received from

the system.

\[image: 637ebecf-93cc-4d8d-975d-ee181a6ff8d1.png\]

Hi Rita,

Sorry I couldn't reply back to you.( I already told Srinivas yesterday

separately, so forgot to reply back to all by email)

Since this account is not included in Target Account List,TST can proceed

with AS-IS process (out of Eagle X).

But to capture potential lanes for the future, we would like to convert it

and save the sata in Tender DB separately.

Thanks & Regards,

Kazuki Masuda

Coz our understanding of Target Accounts list are those \>6 mths long term

accounts listed in Tender Calendar, can we understand you mentioned below

"this account is not included in Target Account list" referring to Sep-Nov

released accounts (prioritize for the conversion study now)?

Hi Rita,

Yes, every month, we inform the target list to Sales and Pricer so that

everyone can be aware of the Eagle X target next month.

This target account list is based on the GCSM tender calendar \+ some

adjustment.

Also, in advance, we need to complete the pre-conversion before releasing

each target account.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qzMdUlX59ZWbwi9sFTqGO\_B2QBs7PZxQCLmR2E9VDXw/edit?gid=158175470\#gid=158175470

But, I understand that release months can change.

\- The release month is not correct.

\- The tender sheet arrives earlier (later) than scheduled

In that case, we need to consider it case by case by considering the

deadline, related trades, customer sheet(workable) etc..

Thanks & Regards,

Kazuki Masuda

Dear Masuda san,

Yours noted and it's clear now.

Sorry to have one more question, below 3 accounts are tagged 'Workable'

under the Target Account list, but WNS reported 'Unworkable" but not

confirmed by GHQ, so below 3 accounts are workable or unworkable?

Dear Rita,

Thanks for highlighting.

Initially it was declared as 'Unworkable' by WNS India but eventually it is

workable with workaround (Already registered in DB as well).

I believe WNS India understood the workarounds already but let us know if

you feel any unclear points.

Thanks & Regards,

Just want to know below DB still showing 'unworkable' for these a/cs,

should it be updated by GHQ or WNS if it becomes workable after workarounds?

## (Sales Feedback) \[EagleX-LIVE-FY25\] Final Consolidated Offer\_ G-JP103815\_ TOYO TIRE & RUBBER\_ seq01\_ R1 ver.47\_084\_W/O\_077-081

受信: Wed Aug 21 2024 11:32:17 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Takahiro Fujiwara \<takahiro.fujiwara@one-line.com\>  
Dear Cali san and all,

Thank you for your continuous support with this tender.

Here are some of the points I noticed upon reviewing the consolidated file.

Pls kindly treat this as sales feedback and let us know if you have any

questions.

\*\<To CST\>\*

\- 1st T/S port: Sales request was to input 1st T/S port only (single port),

but noticed several ports were input for some lanes. Example: ONE Lane ID

127\.

\- Number of T/S: Sales remarks regarding T/T input were not followed

correctly for some lanes, and domestic tranship in JPN was not counted.

Example: ONE Lane ID 442\.

\[image: image.png\]

\- Pricer Remark: Apart from the "Internal Remark" column, some pricers

input internal remarks on the external submission column "Remarks

(Carrier)" and we had to delete this before submission.

It's better to have internal remarks in one location only, in order to

avoid any misunderstanding between pricer & sales.

\- OBS input (1): There were some lanes missing OBS although rates were

offered. Example: ONE Lane ID 176/177.

\- OBS input (2): OBS charges were mistakenly input in the rate section.

Example: ONE Lane ID 1418\.

\- OBS input (3): OBS charges for live reefer were input where it should be

RAD. Example: ONE Lane ID 407\.

\- EU-ETS: Figures were input for destination UK where EU-ETS is not

applicable. On the other hand, input was missing for lanes where this

charge is applicable.

\*\<To Pricers\>\*

\- Route summary: Pricer submission was missing which led to

searching/updating the routes one by one before external submission. We had

to give up on some lanes since we could not find any feasible route

on OPUS. It would be ideal if this input is made mandatory against pricers,

and submission cannot be completed until they clarify the specific routes

to take.

For the lanes which pricers did not provide the route summary, T/T and CO2

emission input were also missing (due to T/T tool not workable).

\- Freetime input: Some pricers input C (for calendar days) or W (for

working days) in the cells where digits should be input. Example: ONE Lane

ID 950/959/960/961.

\- Freetime Match (Y/N): Some pricers have not followed our sales

intention, and we had to update manually. Below was our sales intention in

the T\&C summary.

\[image: image.png\]

\- Freetime: ONE Logic was not followed for some lanes which may lead to an

error during the post tender filing process.

Example: ONE Lane ID 677/683/688 under OC Domi, we cannot offer DMOF and

should be CTOC.

\*\<Others\>\*

\- As frontline sales, I am not very familiar with the "Service Lane Group

Name", Domi/Non Domi.

\- The "Trade Name" column was useful, but we are more familiar with the

"Service Scope Code" such as TPE/AEW/IAA etc.

\- Personally, it would be much easier to know which trade mktg have or have

not completed submission if we can know the applicable trade by "Service

Scope Code", instead of "Service Lane Group Name".

Dear Cali san,

Good day.

Regarding A/C Toyo Tire, there were 32 lanes missing "Route Summary" input

in your final consolidated sheet (despite the rate offer).

Trade marketing teams who have not provided route summary are as follows.

Should we check directly with them for further details?

\- FE Domi ZFW

\- LW Domi

\- LE Domi

\- OC Domi

We have some time until Round 2, and would like to make use of this time to

complete the route summary on our end.

Thank you.

Dear Nakai san, Darrell san, and all concerned,

Thank you for your support with A/C Toyo Tire tender (seq01).

This is a very minor point, but we noticed a possible error with CO2

emission input.

The figures show 32300kg, but I think the total distance was input by

mistake.

(total distance from JPYKK to GTGUA is 16,150km and maybe this was

multiplied by two for FEU)

TOYO TIRE & RUBBER\_ seq01

ONE Lane ID 101

POR/DEL: JPYKK \- GTGUA Door

There is no need to send us a revised consolidated file, but would like to

share above for your reference.

Thank you.

Best Regards,

Fujiwara san,

Thank you for sharing below.

Fundamentally correct information based on TT tool can be migrated to

customer sheet automatically as long as TT tool covers the port pair.

Unless it covers, offshore team will need to be mindful of their manual

input.

If the issue was only this port pair, I guess CST members may have

conducted wrong manual input due to no coverage of TT tool.

Darrel / CST team,

If my guesstimate is wrong, please correct me and clarify why this case

happened.

Best regards,

Koji Nakai

\*Dear Nakai san, \*

\*cc : Fujiwara san,\*

Thank you for your email.

Upon investigation from our working file, the lane mentioned was manually

inputted from our side and not generated by the TT tool.

We have overlooked the TT details by the total distance instead of the CO2

emission.

We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused. Will ensure to be more

extra-careful in our input. Thank you \!

Masuda san and Ben,

I have created filters for AEWB Focus Candidate GP Wave 1 lists in \[TEST\]

Status List FY25 for quick reference,

AEWB GP 1

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x9okj6yZDHirDF2nlxMbX\_aXtHbHoDr0wLhtcU4Dj9o/edit?gid=169003602\#gid=169003602\&fvid=486601484\>

which is for virtual GP meeting,

AEWB GP 2

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x9okj6yZDHirDF2nlxMbX\_aXtHbHoDr0wLhtcU4Dj9o/edit?gid=169003602\#gid=169003602\&fvid=1637196870\>

which is for email exchange discussion.

Looking at both lists, pre-conversion study status is either "In Progress"

or "Not Started". Appreciate if you could expedite the pre-conversion study

for AEWB GP 1 then followed by AEWB GP 2\.

Please note we are to share AEWB Focus Candidate GP Wave 1 by next week,

therefore appreciate if you could \*at least\* complete pre-conversion study

for AEWB GP 1

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x9okj6yZDHirDF2nlxMbX\_aXtHbHoDr0wLhtcU4Dj9o/edit?gid=169003602\#gid=169003602\&fvid=486601484\>

Dear Flourance,

The accounts have been added into Status List.

By the way, most of them seems to be excluded from GCSM tender list, so

\- I updated sales PIC based on info in ONEForce

\- Prefill them all as onshore accounts, with tender release 2 months prior

to the contract expiration.

\- For Intex, I'm removing contract number as there is no info in there

(only validity that set as in 2025).

## NVOが絡むTender Sampleの件

受信: Tue Aug 06 2024 18:37:27 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Ai Sakuma \<ai.sakuma@one-line.com\>  
仲井さん、増田さん

お疲れ様です。

NVOが絡むTenderについて、①コマツと②日立建機のサンプル2件を送ります。

複数のNVOがTenderに参加する場合に作成する \*a) 指示書(BID参加者と締切を管理)\* と\* b)コンフリクト確認(Customer

Formatに落とし込んで、既存レーンとFreeレーンの判別)\*が日本語で作成されているため、

日本語にて失礼します。

①②共に1次オファーはBIZ

OWNERがEagle-Xを通して全体像を把握、かつ、複数のNVO担当者と情報をシェアすることが可能ですが、2次オファー以降はBIDに参加するNVOの数も減り、

フィードバックを受けるタイミングも締め切りも異なるため、以前ご提案した通り、R2以降は分割Pricingができる仕組みづくりが必要です。

現状CVAではNAC指定ができないため、NVO経由で獲得した①や②はNIPPON

EXPRESSやKWEの総計に含まれてしまい詳細を追うことができません。

一方、R2以降NVOもEagle-XのPricingを通しTender

DBに情報が入ることにより、①コマツや②日立建機の全体像が把握できるようになりますので、検証・開発のほどよろしくお願いいたします。

確認ですが、これは今期のTarget account（すなわちstatus list）対象という事で合っていますか。

ご既承の通り、今期はTender calendarをベースにしたアカウント（主にBCO）をEagle

Xターゲットと設定しており、複数NVOが絡むような場合はNonターゲットとしております。

従いまして、JPNとしてTarget accountに設定していない限り、、今期は以下のようなケースはEagle X

のPricingツールを使わないという理解ですが、如何でしょうか。

上記は、先日、鳥原さん、深井さんがご来星された時にお話させて頂いた内容および先般シェア致しましたEagle X overview

（rollout資料）になります。

本件、お待たせしてしまいましたが先日GHQの出張の際とオンラインの打ち合わせでもご依頼頂きました、NVOのサンプルをご連絡しました。本番環境での

お試し はできませんので、我々の中でシミュレーションを行うという話であったかと思います。(来年へ繋げるため、開発は継続する)

もし今期はシミュレーション・開発も行わないようであればJapanとしては問題ありません。

来年テンダー終わるタイミングで再度、NVOのツールとプロセスを検討できればと思います。

以下、ありがとうございます。

今期のターゲットからは基本的には外すものの、来期を見据えて準備を進めていくという事に異存はございません。

まずは9月から始まるGo Liveに集中しつつ、ある段階でこちらについても検討を始めたいと思います。

少々お時間を要すると思いますが、ご理解頂ければと存じます。

## \*\* EUA Sales\*\* Eagle X FY24-25 Tender Season Scope

受信: Mon Aug 05 2024 19:30:16 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Giselle Lopes \<giselle.lopes@one-line.com\>  
Dear EUA Sales,

\*(Trade in copy: FYR) : no action required. \*

I'd like to add the below on the scope of the Eagle X tender processing

tools for FY2025, so everyone is clear:

\*Quote:\*

1\. Eagle X Game Plan Tool (Route Portfolio Simulation) will go live from

Sep 2024, targeting Oct released Tenders.

2\. Eagle X Conversion / Pricing Tool will also go live from Sep 2024

however targeting Sep released Tenders.

In other words,

All tenders released in Sep will go through FY25 Eagle X Process (excludes

Game Plan).

All tenders released in Oct will go through FY25 Eagle X Process (includes Game

Plan which is conducted in Sep \- one month before tender release).

\[image: image.png\]

\*End of quote\*

In line with this, \*EUA SALES\* please review and update the month of

release for all your 2025 tenders in the provided calendar \- \*if not done

so, already. \*

\*2025 EUA Tender Control \- RHQ London \*\* Open for editing\*\* \*

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13frnfJacgEpM2pDZm4eQktTOpkmiJkHdPY4lNopCDd4/edit?gid=0\#gid=0\>

\*Note: The sheet is open for editing. To update your tender information

directly, simply navigate to the designated area without altering the

existing formatting or adding rows/columns. \*

\*This\*\* link will be closed on Friday \- 9th Aug 2024.\*

This information is essential for the timely preparation of the Eagle X

Game Plan and Route Portfolio Simulation. Ensure child codes (customer

codes) are accurate as well as they will be used for CVA processing. Please

inform us of any discrepancies to avoid delays.

Also, here's the \*SALES focus\* training information:

Hello Nicole

No, game plan will be via Eagle X \- since Michelin release month is M10.

For customers in the tender calendar but with unworkable customer sheets,

which is the case of Michelin, Eagle X team will proceed with Game Plan

creation and RPS using available data. While potential volume may not be

accurately reflected in the simulation sheet, we will establish target

volumes within the Game Plan.

Kasia and ALL,

Thank you for your joining rollout session in LON/RTM.

We were able to have a constructive and fruitful discussion with all of you.

As you are aware, this year's target will be more ambitious and challenging

compared to last year's result.

We Eagle X team will do our best to support all the stakeholders and

achieve this target as much as possible.

Having said that, Eagle X processes/tools are not 100% perfect so please

always let us know if any issues.

Your support would be greatly appreciated.

受信: Thu Aug 08 2024 22:46:40 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Kenichi Michida \<kenichi.michida@one-line.com\>  
Hi Kasia and all,

I would like to express our sincere thanks for your great efforts to

arrange the Eagle X roll out meeting last month.

I got quite a positive impression from the audience in the meeting.

In addition, the listed feedback and items during the session should be

quite valuable to enhance our capabilities and streamline the process.

This information should be really crucial for us to implement the process

smoothly (not only EUA but also global implementation).

As per my initial comment in the session, this process evolution can be one

of the biggest challenges in FY2024 from the M\&C perspective. However, we

believe that this process can generate huge benefits in the downstream side

including tender quality management, more comprehensive pricing, easier

award management and filing. One of the biggest values is to enhance the

pipeline management by a quite comprehensive database based on the tender

data which can cover all Eagle X customers. This data can be connected to

the ONE Force for quick customer analysis and easier cargo hunting in the

end.

In this connection, we would like to collaborate with EUA regions

continuously for the purpose of process implementation.

Again, I would appreciate you very much for your initiatives and future

cooperation in advance on behalf of GHQ M\&C management. Let's work together

for good success.

Best regards,

Mitch

your reference.

We're using Market stats (GTAS) and Eagle X Data (ONEFormat & CVA) to

compare.

I understand you're also helping to check the data quality which I asked to

the PwC team.

Soon or later, we may release this in Prod as a prototype, so it would be

helpful if it can be fixed as much as possible.

Dear Carla,

good day

Thank you so much for taking care of the booking and transport arrangements

for the EagleX rollout in Chile.

Regarding the transport reservation, I couldn't find it for Flourance Tan's

departure on Aug 10th (from Santiago to the airport).

Please, could you double-check it?

Obs.: For safety's sake, please note that Lilia Paragua and Gabriele

Oliveira won't join EagleX meetings (not sure on whether they are visiting

CL for other purposes).

I appreciate your check and return.

## Eagle X \- Recap of discussion points with Zach & Michael

受信: Tue Jul 30 2024 00:40:24 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Koji Nakai \<koji.nakai@one-line.com\>  
小寺さん

先週金曜日にZach /

Michaelとディスカッションした内容ですが、簡単な備忘録としてシェアさせて頂きます。（増田さん、当方の理解が間違えておりましたら訂正お願いします）

Eagle Xの総論はOK、各論は引き続きディスカッション要と理解しておりますが、短い時間ながら二人と直接話せたのは非常に良かったです。

\*(Recap of discussion)\*

   1\. FY24 (FY25 tender)において、グローバル全体としてall Long contract (主にBCO)はEagle

   Xを通す事を説明。9月以降にtender sheetを受領するアカウントをターゲットにする。

   2\. FY23はNA Salesの関与は全く無く、Initial check-in / check listといった作業もNA

   Mktgの方で対応。FY24は本来Salesが行うべき作業はSalesが行う事に2人共同意。

   3\. 但し、グローバルでの開始時期である9月からNA Salesを巻き込むよりも、11月3週目に行われるEagle

   meetingの時にSalesに対してRolloutするのがスムーズではないかとZachが提案。

   9月、10月のonshoreアカウント数(Canadian Tire等)は4,5件と限られているので、これはFY23のようにNA

   MktgがInitial check-in / check listを行って対応可能とMichaelも同意。

   4\. Onshoreアカウントの数は限られているが、Offshoreアカウント(SalesにInitial

   check-inをしてもらうことを想定)も9月、10月に多少あるので、この取り扱い方については別途確認要。

   （この点は十分ディスカッション出来なかったため）

   5\. Game Planにおいて、MichaelからはTPEBとしてEagle meetingのタイミングでSimualtion

   sheetを準備するので、グローバルプロセス(Tender release 1ヶ月前)にフォローするのは難しい。

   こちらにおいては、NA Mktg (TPEB)は全アカウントをSimulation sheetを使ってGame

   Planしているという理解の為、TPEBのタイミングで進めてもらって問題ないと思料致します。

   但し、NA contractではないものの、TPEBが絡むようなケースにおいてもGame Planを行っているのか、この点について確認要。

NA RHQに伺うタイミングは少し後ろ倒しになりましたが、8月-10月の間のreguar

callでしっかりディスカッションを行い、スムーズにRolloutを進めれるように対応して参ります。

引き続き宜しくお願い致します。

仲井

## Fwd: Eagle X \- Recap of discussion points through EUA rollout (22-26 Jul '24)

受信: Mon Jul 29 2024 23:37:26 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Koji Nakai \<koji.nakai@one-line.com\>

\---------- Forwarded message \---------

From: Koji Nakai \<koji.nakai@one-line.com\>

Subject: Eagle X \- Recap of discussion points through EUA rollout (22-26

Jul '24)

To: Takahiro Kikuchi \<takahiro.kikuchi@one-line.com\>, Stanley Smulders \<

stanley.smulders@one-line.com\>

Cc: Kenichi Michida \<kenichi.michida@one-line.com\>

Dear Kikuchi san / Stanley,

(cc Michida san)

Hope this email finds you well.

Please be advised that we GHQ SYM/DYM Eagle X team visited LON/RTM RHQ last

week and conducted a rollout to EUA Stakeholders (Trade/Sales).

I'm sorry that I missed the opportunity to see both of you.

I would like to share the high level summary of discussion points with you

for your reference. (Also, please find the attached project overview)

Of course, for detailed items we will take actions one by one separately.

\*Overview\*

1\) Stakeholders are generally supportive of Eagle X concept though we need

to continuously consider simplification of Processes / tools.

     In order for them to handle Go Live tender via Eagle X process

smoothly from Sep onwards, Eagle X team will conduct a follow up session to

Trade / Sales in Aug.

 2\) Stakeholders have shown strong interest in the Tender database, which

will provide comprehensive data through Tender execution

      (e.g. Potential volume / Target volume / Award volume by

various granularities).

    We are currently developing Tender DB as a mock up based on last FY's

Eagle X activity though the number of accounts was still limited (approx

200 accounts).

    Since we will expand our target to all Long accounts via Eagle X

process as per management direction, we anticipate a more enriched database

in future.

\*Game Plan\*

1\) Stakeholders understood the importance of Game Plan using Route

Portfolio Simulation sheet well. (on port pair basis)

    Since EUA Trade (except AEWB/TAWB) haven't used simulation sheet yet,

we recognize the need for Trade / Sales to familialize themselves with the

tool.

    We will prepare samples of the Game Plan sheet prior to official launch in

Sep to provide clear understanding and visibility.

\*Conversion\*

1\) While conversion process/tool itself remains largely unchanged, EUA

Sales will need to get used to Conversion process / tool as most of them

didn't proceed via Eagle X last FY.

    The hands-on session indicated a need for further training to deepen

understanding. We will conduct a follow up session to EUA Sales.

    Additionally, EUA\* Sales Ambassador's role w\*ill\* be \*\*crucial\* for a

smooth transition.

\*Pricing tool\*

1\) We have revamped the pricing tool as FY25 tender model, incorporating

valuable feedback from respective trade across the region.

     A notable change is the rate structure part that Pricer will be able

to select applicable surcharges by themselves based on Sales intention.

(same as current Pricing Simulation in OPUS)

      Through the hands-on session in LON/RTM, we got positive feedback

from Pricers though we got some requests to be rectified and added.

     (e.g. AEEB requested us that Sales should select rate structure

instead of selecting by Pricer)

     We will seek best practice across the region and continue to enhance

the tool to make it more user friendly and efficient.

2\) \*W\*\*e \*\*proposed \*\*EUA SYM to set dedicated Eagle X members\* to support

EUA Trade in a timely manner. (same request as RHQ management Meeting in

May)

    Last FY, GHQ Eagle X team supported all the pricers across the region

by working night shifts but that will not be a sustainable approach.

    We would propose the following plan, aiming for implementation before

peak season. Your consideration would be highly appreciated.

        \*Aug\* : Nominate Eagle X support members in EUA

        \*1st half of Sep\* : Conduct briefing/training session in GHQ

(1week)

\*Filing / Award\*

1\) Eagle X process will enable the input of nomination volume into CVA

template without manual input by Sales which is a significant pain point

due to its time consuming workload.

     Sales have responded positively to this improvement.

    Additionally, timely monitoring of nomination volume will be beneficial

from Trade perspective.

2\) Since the final Filing / Award tool is expected to be completed around Oct,

we will conduct a rollout to Trade/Sales once it is ready.

We Eagle X will do our best to succeed this project, hence your support

would be appreciated.

Should you have any questions, please kindly let the writer know.

Best regards,

Koji Nakai

## FY24 Eagle X Rollout \- EUA \- Quick Summary

受信: Mon Jul 29 2024 18:51:49 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Flourance Tan \<flourance.tan@one-line.com\>  
Nakai san, and team,

Please view below quick summary from FY24 Eagle X Rollout at EUA.

\*1. Overall Process\*

\- Stakeholders express concerns on E2E coverage (as well as NPRD)

especially related to New Product.

\- To have proper instructions to ensure tender pricing process via Eagle X

Process globally, and clear definitions of Target / Non-Target Accounts and

Long term contracts.

\- In case of Non-Target Accounts especially for NVO NAC which are common as

only inquiry, to consider how to conduct Initial Check In due to

non-existing Actual Customer Code might not be available.

\- Sales are getting less involved in the entire pricing process, to

consider how to keep Sales aware of the offer as well as portal upload

process.

\*2. Game Plan Process\*

\- Generally Sales would usually change the target volume when new tender is

received especially in case of substantial volume change. Sales would like

to discuss the target volume even after R1 submission, as long as it is

still valid for tender negotiations.

\- For case 3 (tender release earlier than schedule), necessary information

such as potential volume and champion trade etc would still be required

from Sales to Trade MKTG. Sales should also get involved in the target

setting.

\- To split IEA from AE NonDomi and provide summary by Service Lane / Bound

(export / import) basis.

\- For AE NonDomi, prefer to adjust game plan by destination grouping (e.g.

destination country China) instead of location level.

\- From Sales, Revenue Lane granularity is not required, which would be only

decided during AP prep.  \=\> Consider same approach as TP Domi FOB / TP

NonDomi.

\*3. Conversion Process\*

\- (\*Sales Review\*) Concern if Sales Review is not completed within 24

hours, who is responsible, and how to proceed conversion and pricing

release.

\- (\*Location Mapping\*) How to manage port cluster / group location as well

as drop down for POR/POL/POD/DEL from customer sheet.

\- (\*TT Input\*) Concern about having CST to input TT details for missing

routings in TT Tool, where Pricer should be responsible for the routings. \=\>

Consider and conduct case study on alternative routing.

\- (\*TT Input\*) TAT has concern on missing US Door routings due to NA IOP

deleting routes. \=\> Eagle X to flag out during NA session.

\- To share process updates in case of additional lanes / customer sheets

amended after conversion.

\*4. Pricing Process\*

\- Generally Pricers agreed to Set Surcharge. Except AEEB who insists Sales

to select surcharges by suggesting Eagle X team to equip checkbox in

Conversion Tool.

\- To consider FIFO charges are not by default inclusive.

\- To have the option to remove Doc (per BL surcharges) / local surcharges

from All-In Rate / CM Calculations. \=\> Consider to have checkbox in All-In

Rate Calculation button.

\- If Pricers adjust Game Plan Target during pricing process, consider how

to keep Sales updated. \=\> Retrieve the information into Consolidation Tool

for reference \> Prepare Game Plan Summary for Sales.

\- To consider how to Export multiple tiers of DMT Tariffs to customer file.

\- In the future, if Debug is encountered by Pricer and unable to move

forward, how to address. \==\> Debug guidance.

\- Concern on E2E coverage and what if new product / constraints from

subsequent rounds. \==\> Eagle X team to refresh E2E Route database from

subsequent rounds and highlight if R1 E2E Route is no longer existing in

the latest.

\- For inland cases, to consider actual Transport Cost in E2E Cost / CM

Calculation.

\*5. Award Filing Process\*

\- At least service scope wise award to be filed.

\- Do not see why non awarded lanes need to be filed.

\- Visibility of rate offer on top of offered rate structure so that trade

can cross check before signing off.

\- Process for new awards received after Filing.

\*6. IOP Pricing Process\*

\- IOP to share the decline reason for IOP pricing offer.

\- Preset IOP Remarks in \[Submit\] button: Please contact IOP Pricers if you

wish to change any POL or POD.

\- With tender DB, ability to view IOP inland locations with potential \+

actual volume (lifting), and final IOP rate offer.

\- Mystery area for NAM / LAT to EUA inland as they rarely check on IOP rate

offer.  \=\> Eagle X to flag out during LA / NA sessions.

\- Include all EUA pricers in IOP Pricing Tool submission regardless of the

same or separate sheet.

\*7. Special Cargo Pricing Process\*

\- To consider scenario for Special Cargo's Target CM/TEU given accuracy of

E2E Cost.

\- To have Expected CM/TEU for AF\_OH, AF\_OW, AF\_FV (divided by 4 / 6 / 12

teus).

\- SCM to share LTMRG in Giraffe format (CY/CY lanes).

EOM

Please let me know if any further clarification is required. Thank you.

Best Regards,

\*Flourance Tan\*

Hi Sakuma san

Thank you for today's mtg.

We have analyzed the contract master with each service scope duration which

you mentioned in the mtg.

After we omitted these contracts (no "long" duration for all service

scope), there are 184 Contracts (= BCO 125 \+ Direct 59\) which are "long" \+

not included in Tender Calendar.

\[PIV\_All\]

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HpEOtMtQdzf3BZedwWfTxr0q\_iBAhSG3wkDVQl7hoxs/edit?gid=1120683969\#gid=1120683969\>

\[image: image.png\]

Is it possible for you to double check if you don't need to include these

accounts in Tender Calendar?

(184 Contracts for 153 Accounts)

\[PIV\_JP\]

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HpEOtMtQdzf3BZedwWfTxr0q\_iBAhSG3wkDVQl7hoxs/edit?gid=1533283604\#gid=1533283604\>

\[image: image.png\]

(for your info)

Please refer to the result of each service scope duration analysis.

As you said in the mtg, some customers have no "long" service scope even if

the contract duration says "long".

受信: Thu Jun 27 2024 14:01:58 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Ai Sakuma \<ai.sakuma@one-line.com\>  
Dear Terada san

Thank you for your time.

As per our discussion, both CVA and OPUS aren't reliable because of the

following reasons.

To summarize JP Eagle X Accounts, I have listed the Long Term (more than 6

months) BCO accounts based on Pipeline which is around 350\. Pls kindly find

the attached file.

CVA (JP) : 1 month, 3 month duration accounts are all adjusted to 6 months

when CVa uploading, so almost all accounts are Long Term (6 month)

regardless of the actual contract

                  Current Tender Calendar information (additional accounts

based on CVA) is including all Long Term accounts including adjusted ones,

so it has to be deleted in some timing.

OPUS- : Duration, Contract Length, SVC Scope Duration can't be reliable, so

appreciate to check whether it is possible to capture "Effective Date" &

"Expiration Date" information which will reflect the latest information.

I have analyzed customer lists (Eagle X Scope) based on Flourance input.

\*Overall\*

I understand that we need to scope in

\- yellow (already included in Tender Calendar) &

\- orange (not included and Contract Effective date is "Long (over 6

months)")

highlighted accounts as below.

\[image: image.png\]

\*Missing accounts (Request your investigation)\*

We would like to focus on orange highlighted accounts to consider if we

need to add in our scope.

After I filtered out only orange accounts, I compared with Pipeline list.

\[image: image.png\]

It would be great if you could investigate if we don't need to include the

following accounts in Tender Calendar.

\- blue    (not included in pipeline)

\- green  (included in pipeline)

Dear Terada san

Thank you for analyzing the list.

Confirmed that the list is based on Contract Effective date sheet as

"Actual Long (over 6 months)".

As there are contracts which are already expired/invalid, appreciate to

remove the contracts which are invalid as of 20240701 even if the contract

period is Long(over 6 month).

For the Contract Customer Type Code (Regulatory) showing "Direct", I found

out that it is based on below Contract Type selection when creating SC.

Considering this, I guess "Direct (Owner of the cargo)" is mainly for BCO.

Dear Terada san

As per our discussion, I have looked into the purple highlighted accounts.

For the "Expire" flag, pls remove total 10 accounts as they are all FY23

Contract. For others NOT Expired, pls maintain in the list as they are

actually Long Term (over 6 month) contract.

Dear Sakuma san

Thank you for your confirmation.

I have updated the list of Contracts (PIV\_JP\_BCO

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HpEOtMtQdzf3BZedwWfTxr0q\_iBAhSG3wkDVQl7hoxs/edit?gid=1049006472\#gid=1049006472\>

).

This sheet focuses on "need to update Tender Calendar" accounts.

\[image: image.png\]

If you open column E, you can refer to Account names as follows.

\[image: image.png\]

It would be great if you could confirm belows

\*For Delete accounts\*

Regarding "Delete" accounts, I think it may be better to keep them in

Tender Calendar because these accounts may submit a tender sheet in this

year even though ONE has no effective contract today but ONE had an Award

in the previous year.

I would like to know your thoughts on this.

\*For Add Accounts\*

Is it possible for you to update the Tender Calendar based on the above

lists?

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Best Regards,

Terada

Dear Terada san

I have reviewed the list again.

Appreciate to "ADD" accounts in green.

1\) Master \- Long Term accounts, pls add 35 accounts (included in pipeline)

2\) Tender Calendar \- Long Term accounts, pls add 9 accounts i/o deleting

For 35 accounts (not included in pipeline) in blue, will double check and

revert to you.

\[image: image.png\]

Addition to above, appreciate to "DELETE" from Tender Calendar which is not

JP handling contract. We will separately inform RHQ.

G-ID106265 SOUTH PACIFIC VISCOSE

G-ID106600 TD AUTOMOTIVE COMPRESSOR INDONESIA

G-ID111540 EUROKARS MOTOR INDONESIA (EMI)

With these adjustments, what will the total account be for JP? Is

it possible to see the overall picture in TC\_Original format?

Moving forward, appreciate to arrange below.

Good Morning Thipthida

I got a request from JP SYM to create the JP list as soon as possible

regarding the below email.

Therefore I drafted the list as this

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x9okj6yZDHirDF2nlxMbX\_aXtHbHoDr0wLhtcU4Dj9o/edit?gid=1067373348\#gid=1067373348\>

.

I will discuss this with JP SYM to finalize this.

After finalizing it, I would like you to combine this sheet to "Add New

Account Data" sheet and proceed to create folders.

Sorry for confusing you and thank you in advance.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Best Regards,

Terada

お疲れ様です。

Eagle X JP Accountに関して遅くなり申し訳ございません。

こちらの様に、JP一覧を作成しております。

（こちらで問題なければThipthidaに統合してもらうことを想定しております）

下記ご確認頂き、ご不明な点等あれば何なりとご連絡ください。

１．下記考えをもとに作成しております

・We have updated Tender Calendar (268 Accounts)

\- Please refer this

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HpEOtMtQdzf3BZedwWfTxr0q\_iBAhSG3wkDVQl7hoxs/edit?gid=459826640\#gid=459826640\>

 sheet

\- filtered out by Japan in column BA (Controlling Country)

\- 268 accounts are scoped in customers from Tender Calendar

・We have another Eagle X Target Accounts except Tender Calendar (70 \+ α

Accounts)

\- we need to identify these customers

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HpEOtMtQdzf3BZedwWfTxr0q\_iBAhSG3wkDVQl7hoxs/edit?gid=905201259\#gid=905201259\>

which

are identified by OPUS Contract (70 Accounts)

\- Please keep NVO accounts which we conducted last year at Live Env.

２．下記詳細な見方について記載します。特にご確認/追記頂きたい事項は下記赤字部分です

\*リスト全体の会社数について（行の確認について）\*

・まず、G列を見て頂くと、上記考え方に基づいた、BCO 270社、OTH 70社、NVO 93社でナンバリング実施

・但し、NVO\_20以降は、FY24にて登録されたものの、R1 Completeまで至っていないもの

→こちら昨年登録のみのものは削除を想定していますがその理解で問題ないでしょうか

\*入力したデータ内容について（列の確認について）\*

基本的にオレンジハイライト箇所を重点的に確認いただければと考えておりますが、

詳細含め下記/赤字部分含めご参照ください。

\[image: image.png\]

・原則として各基礎資料（BCOはTC

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HpEOtMtQdzf3BZedwWfTxr0q\_iBAhSG3wkDVQl7hoxs/edit?gid=459826640\#gid=459826640\>

、OTHはContract

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HpEOtMtQdzf3BZedwWfTxr0q\_iBAhSG3wkDVQl7hoxs/edit?gid=905201259\#gid=905201259\>

、NVOは昨年度Status List

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jasGuDj-5kTE8L7ehzauEDa9jwcr5lcie\_rlVt0TAic/edit?gid=1038615440\#gid=1038615440\>

）から取得

・M列の「Reason for dividing Sequence NO.」は、

\- BCOはTender Name等から確認

\- OTHは契約番号ごとに分けているので結果としてSC/RFAの要因と判断し記載

→M列のオレンジハイライト箇所については、統合する必要がないか？分ける場合に、Reasonが合っているか？を確認ください

・R列の「★Contract No.」は、NVOは昨年度のStatus Listから取得なので、番号が古いと思われます

→R列のオレンジハイライト箇所について、ご確認/アップデートお願い致します

・U列の「★Tender Release period flag」は、OTHは基礎情報なし

→U列のオレンジハイライト箇所について、ご入力お願い致します

・AB列以降の契約期間やPICについては、頂いた情報で埋められるものは埋めております

→オレンジハイライト箇所について、ご入力お願い致します

お疲れ様です。

先ほどはお時間もいただきありがとうございました。

\*全体リスト\*

こちら

\*分類確認\*

分類は下記

でご確認ください。

色付けのものはこれまでの議論の数とイメージ合うかとは思います。

\[image: image.png\]

\*詳細確認\*

一方で、Seqによってカテゴリーが相違するものが出ているので、

（e.g.過去seq02-04はEagle Xであったが、seq01はEagle

Xになく、今回のTCに含まれる→多分このケースはTCが合っているので、現状の登録でいいと思われます）

こちら

シートにMINEBEA

MITSUMIが3件あるのはなぜでしょう？Seq01と02のはずなのですが。

\[image: image.png\]

②上2つはCodeは変更せず、名称だけ更新。

一番下はMITSUBISHI CORPORATIONに関するはずですが、Liveでも01-04は見当たらないので答えが分かりません。

NAC : CGCと、Customer Name : MITSUBISHI RTMのみ残したいです。

今後、こちらをFolder 登録していこうと思いますが、Sales PICや契約番号のアップデートは去れますでしょうか（オレンジハイライト箇所）。

最終化したシートをありがとうございます。約380件ですね。

本シートを営業に展開し、Contract Duration、Sales PIC、契約番号などの情報を8/20頃締切で確認してもらう予定です。

特に機械的に追加した約160件(Contract : 70件、CVA : 88件)は、本当に6ヵ月以上の案件なのか、Customer

Formatある/なしの確認も必要になります。

営業確認後には、削除になる案件、Seq No.を追加する案件が出て来ますので、8/23頃には最終形のファイルを提出できればと思います。

ついては、Eagle X の全体リストへの反映は、最終形のファイルを提出後の方が良いと思いますが、問題ないでしょうか？

8月・9月の早期開始のTenderについては最終形のファイルにも入れますが、Tender自体が始まってしまうため個別対応をお願いできれば幸いです。よろしくお願いいたします。

Hi Lenadro

Let me share the latest Filing / Award Mock.

I understand you need to prepare each mock for each process.

\[image: image.png\]

I would like to share the latest mock for each process.

It would be great if you could update examples etc.

If you have questions, let's discuss via chat or Meets.

\*① Initial check-in\*

Although we will try to combine every questionnaire to Initial check-in, we

may need to create Conversion Checklist.

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-doxoZ4FjEzUv80gzKy1O1fnGzdaMfjkEjVXL8MVafg/edit

\[image: image.png\]

\*② Sales Review Tool \- 1\. For Review Conversion Result by Combine Data\*

I have finalized the process.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OH8Ay12Hcqm1BQwwx0QXU86WpuWRguqsQW8Ijn3nRH4/edit?gid=721006921\#gid=721006921

\[image: image.png\]

\*③ Sales Review Tool \- 2\. For Filing Process by Filing Template\*

I have finalized the process. The link is the same as above.

(DMT split function is pending)

Template sheets will be created automatically by values in the future.

\[image: image.png\]

\*④ Filing Submission Tool\*

I think it is better to update examples. Is it possible to update it?

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uSQfiY8t8g6hWPPzNmXEKgjy8LfUfTIW9c9iFY6a5ck/edit?gid=1248692365\#gid=1248692365

Dear Terada-san,

Thank you for this\! Apologies for the late acknowledgement.

\*(1) Check-In\*

\- Question about OFT Information in Nomination Sheet is workable.

\- However, I understand that @Kazuki Masuda \<kazuki.masuda@one-line.com\> san

has asked about additional questions with regards to the Nomination Sheet

content in terms of Nomination Volume Unit of Measure. Have we added this

part already?

\*(2) Marched/Combine Sheet Control Panel for Sales\*

\- Most of the required fields for Sales Review have already been

highlighted.

\- However, we will provide a list of other items which were not covered in

the series of Steps.

\- We will provide a list of items by tonight or tomorrow morning for

further consideration.

\- In the meantime, one main item that we feel is lacking is the "review"

portion for Awards Columns (e.g. Revenue Lane, et.al.). Was this

intentional?

For the rest of the items, we are presently reviewing and will get back to

you.

(3) Sheet Name and Corresponding Addressees

\- As per our separate discussion, please refer to the attached look up

table for the addressees.
