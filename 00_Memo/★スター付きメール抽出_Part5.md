Kawata san,

Please find the attached CVA format which I shared during yesterday's

meeting. (big file size a bit)

As you can see, Sales need to input annually in limited column as other

columns are already being put formula.

I would reckon that we should be able to automatically migrate necessary

info from Pricing tool (or converted nomination sheet) to the CVA format.

Meanwhile, regarding Volume Agreement Input, confirm it is in line with the

nomination volume for BCO account.

For NVO or non tender account, the volume agreement can use historical

footprint / forecast volume / agreed volume with the customers.

Best regards,

Koji Nakai

Dear Nakai san,

Thank you for sharing the template with us.

This will be really helpful for us to improve the data items for reporting.

As you mentioned, Volume Agreement Input is a bit tricky because it can be

several definitions (like hirecast? or actual? or,,,).

We may need to take care of the timing to issue/publish the report in order

to keep the real time accuracy since the award data can be changed

depending on when we extract.( I mean if we do conduct soon after updated,

there should be no problem, but if we conduct some time later updated,

slightly difference can be shown.)

Probably we can figure out the best timing and frequency during the test

run.

Kind regards,

Haruka kawata

## Eagle X target candidates for February '24

受信: Wed Dec 27 2023 14:55:09 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Koji Nakai \<koji.nakai@one-line.com\>

cc Conversion Unit

Once you are back to the office from holiday, appreciate if you could

prepare Eagle X accounts for \*February '24\* and share it with stakeholders.

From February onwards, we will select accounts under NA who have NA trade

related business only. (1 or 2 accounts/wk would be better to start in Feb)

Would suggest to confirm with NA Mktg what accounts they prefer to target

as Eagle X accounts.

In addition, we need to select offshore accounts discussing with GCSM.

GCSM proposed some criteria to proceed with Eagle X and I personally have

no objection to their proposal at this stage.

I asked GCSM to share the candidate of Eagle X account based on those

criteria with us but haven't received it yet. Will ask them.

Should you have any questions, please let me know.

Best regards,

Koji Nakai

Dear all,

Thank you for your continued support of Eagle X.

As Nakai-san shared earlier, we would like to share the upcoming Eagle X

candidate accounts with Trade Marketing 1 month before go-live.

This will hopefully help with your tender recognition and preparation in

advance.

These are the January Eagle X candidates.

Eagle X candidates for January

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qzMdUlX59ZWbwi9sFTqGO\_B2QBs7PZxQCLmR2E9VDXw/edit\#gid=0\>

\* Please note that we can't technically control the customer's tender

release, so this list is basically our best guess (subject to change).

\* We will keep informing you about upcoming month (Feb, March, April

release tenders)

If you have any questions about Eagle X, please feel free to contact us. We

will be happy to assist as much as possible.

Thanks & Regards,

Kazuki Masuda

Focusing on get 80 plugs per week we agree to match OFT usd 2500 for Osaka

and Tokyo in order to match usd 3100 allin (OBS usd 602/R5).

Osaka will produce our lowest CM of RF on LEE, but we agree to match...

Hi Flourance,

Please, refer to the attached file of Aurora R4 handled out of EagleX due

to time constraints (the customer requested some last-minute adjustments

for punctual rates and the pricer replied within the same day).

As we should have other cases like that, please I would like to discuss a

SOP with GHQ, so that the LATAM stakeholders know how to proceed for

further cases.

Last time this happened with JBS tender and the pricer shared the final

proposal (in the customer Excel file) with GHQ via email. I assume that CST

had updated the pricing tool acc. Is my understanding correct?

I appreciate your comments.

Best Regards,

Dear MKTG AS/AM team / Tathiana/Paulo,

Good afternoon \!

//// VERY URGENT \\\\\\\\

Please kindly note that I received a call from Aurora few minutes ago to

warming us about OBS surcharge, as I sent to them new LEE/LAN/LEA OBS

amount, they are requesting us to review our rate to compensate this huge

increase amount for OBS. Many competitors are considering rates all in so

final proposal do not change for beginning of 2024 (it will be break down

the amount, but is not change to Aurora) , excepted ONE and CMA (whose are

considering new bunker amount), so that, our rates level are high than the

other competitors, so they are requesting to review our proposal to not

change \*Final R3( L columns)\* and revert "very urgent", in order to

allow them to finalize the BID 2024 volume nomination.

PS: Cosco and HMM confirmed to them that all rates are allin for whole

2024\.

LEE \= USD602 to USD732  \= USD130 over.

LEA/LAN \= USD506 to USD618 \= USD112 over.

LEN \= USD420 to TBA \+ ETS \=79 over.

\*Estimated Volume nomination for 2024 (120xctns week)\*

\*LEE \=  SX1/SX2/LUX \= 80xASIA and 10xME\*

Hi Ogawa

Regarding LEE we suggest maximum usd 50 of reduction on OFT (except POD

Osaka), but we really would like to count on your support to concede it

only if \*really\* mandatory..

We regret to see Aurora not respecting the OBS increasing after cleary

emphasized on our proposal.

Awaiting your reply.

Dear Tathi,

Good afternoon \!

Noted with thanks: We explained during the face-to-face meeting about the

increase in OBS considering the Bunker market situation, but we did not

provide any numbers or values. but it will certainly increase, and they

agreed with this scenario. However, the problem or issue was that the

competitors maintained or fulfilled their order, so our proposal increased

another $130 compared to others and took away our competitive advantage. So

we really do not know if we can grant total volume with only USD50 less.

Thank you.

Dear MKT Am team,

Please await your comments. Tks.

Tks for the award.

Regarding LEE (Asia) we will consider 60 cntrs per week.

Did they mentioned some volume for ME ? (just for better understanding if

SX1 or LUX)

Please let us know how many plugs will they load via Itapoa on SX2.

Dear Gilberto san,

Good morning \!

Please kindly note that unfortunately they already informed all carriers

about BID awarder, so they do not expect to change it with forecasted

volume,  they hope to have more volume to Asia /NEUR and MX (It depend on

the import quotas), so additional volume can be ship with us on demand

basis.

Unfortunately our reduction offer of $50/30 was not enough to grant volume

increase as we expected.

Dear Gilberto san , MKT AM/AS Team,

Good morning \!

Please note that as per our face-to-face and HH meeting yesterday, we may

have had the chance to review our BID nomination, we had the opportunity to

talk to them and confirm some points and actions of competitors that

contribute to lowering our initial nomination and that's why they asked us

to revise our proposal at the last minute and follow what the competitors

did, basically most of the competitors adjust to Q1 2024 rates and offset

the Bunker increase as they confirmed for this year the IDB all the fees

were very similar, so unfortunately in relation to fees of just $10 it

makes a difference, however, other points were considered and so our

situation was not worse for referral, but they also complained about our

provision of services that need to be improved considerably. This week they

are complete and scheduled with each operator the 2023

performance, points to improve, service, etc... That's why we have this

opportunity to improve the volume of appointments, consider this, we have

to evaluate and fulfill your requests in regarding the bunker adjustment

and also the ETS waiver of the EUR to be competitive again and participate

with more volume.

The service improvement will be sent to us with all details and shared with

the appropriate areas. Important points highlighted yesterday.

\- Aurora's official volume indicated was around 2,300 ctns per month, but

they expect to have around 2,600 ctns in some months in 1st semester and

certainly in the 2nd half of 2024, but all operators together offered more

than 4,200 ctns per month.

\- They said some carriers will increase ship capacity and new services will

be started (ZIM), this may be why a large volume has already been offered

or some carriers have decided to be less dependent on LARGE reefer exports.

\- The big carriers (EUR carriers) tried to protect the EUR and ME market

since ONE/Cosco really bothered them.

I´m in closer contact with them to update you immediately for

any new information.

\*Dear Marcelo, Tathy and Paulo\*

According to Owaga san information, Aurora was considering ONE to increase

it's participation, however OBS increase really left us in a bad position.

We discussed with them during the last face to face meeting and both MSC

and MSK are offering additional space to them, which means it's mandatory

to revisit OBS if we want to increase our share to 80 cntrs per week (LEE).

In terms of Europe, our rates are totally out and the main reason is

because both Europeans (MSK and MSC) really reduced rates to maintain share.

\*Required revision\*

1\) Maintain all in offer to all service scope, reducing OBS difference in

the Ocean Freight for Q1 2024\. (same exercise we did with JBS tender). If

we align it, we might receive the additional nomination.

2\) Regarding Europe, even maintaining all in offer, we are USD150,00

higher. So, we let you know if you are interested in reducing at least

North Europe.

Hope you can check and revert with final confirmation.

Hi Flourance.

We tried to submit Aurora R4 via Eagle X, however after inputting new

rates, updating new OBS and doing the calculation, the base rate column is

discrepant from R4 offer rate.

Can you pls check and inform?

Hi Katia,

Thank you for highlighting.

Investigated and realised this is due to Currency Exchange Rate issue

especially for THL in column KI. We have rectified it and Base Rate is now

showing the same quantum as per R4 Offer Rate.

We have saved the updated Pricing Tools (both LN Domi and LE NonDomi) in

the same folder. If this is in order, please hit \[Export\] and \[Submit\]

buttons to complete R4 Pricer Submission.

Hi Flourance.

Thanks for your help.

Now the freight is correct, however noted that OBS for LEA is still showing

a discrepant value.

\[image: image.png\]

I have updated it manually and exported to customer sheet, but it seems

that new OBS is not being applied.

Should we submit this way or will it be updated as well?

HI Katia,

Thank you again for highlighting.

1\. Have updated OBS logic for LEA service scope to reflect the below; we

will be cautious for LEA's OBS moving forward.

\[image: image.png\]

2\. Have also updated Pricer Input Indicator and Export column number in

rows 1-2.

Please hit \[Export\] button which the updated OBS will be exported to

Customer Sheet.

\[image: image.png\]

I have also updated for LE NonDomi. Please find both updated Pricing Tools

in below folder. Thank you again for your support and feedback which has

rendered great assistance to improve the logic and user experience 🤗

Hi Ogawa

We agree to reduce usd 130 from all routes except Osaka where we would like

to count on your support to check if possible to grant 80 plugs per week

based on this proposal.

Based on our conversation, Osaka represents 6º position of main destination

in 2023, but it has been the 3º for us.

Maybe customer has some preference on our service and we can consider some

"value".. Or customer can perform the commitment with other destinations.

Awaiting your comments and if mandatory we agree to reduce Osaka too.

Best Regards,

Dear Tathi /Paulo and all,

Good day to you \!

We submitted our revised proposal to Aurora with not touch the Osaka tariff

and it was accepted by them. However for the time being, they will not

revised the official BID awarded, but they told me that there is a

compromise from Aurora side to adjust it in few weeks to attend whole

allocation previously discussed  with around 120 ctns week for all trades

offered, considering our action on bunker for the  1st quarter and ETS

surcharge, so please kindly validity attached excel and final proposal to

provide tariff filing asap. Thank you very much for all involved in this

BIZ that contributed to achieve our goal.

Dear Cassandra/Irving/Natan.

Please kindly advise me how we can proceed to file the tariff accordingly

Hello Ogawa, good day\!

Note that the file you've sent is correct for both trades\! Please proceed

with the filling.

TENDER-Team, hello\!

Our understanding in yesterday's meeting was that since Sales has already

submitted the file to the customer, the consolidation wasn't needed.

But note MKTG had a double work in this case: submit the values via the

tool and check the Sales file to make sure it was correct.

In this case, our point of view is to always finalize the process with the

consolidation so the original file is used.

Please confirm if you agree with above understanding.

Awaiting for your comments\!

Thank you\!

Good day dear Tatiane.

Revising the process yes indeed the consolidation is not necessary when

there is an extra negotiation for the same round that we already

consolidated but the final proposal sent by MKTG team is not always the

same that offered at the F2F/last rounds with customer as sometimes the

sales executive could offer rates higher than the bottom rates shared by

trade.

Saying this we may need to make a final revision of the proposal once the

award is shared by the sales team to confirm which are the last offers to

customer.

Please let me know your comments about it and we may discuss this too in

the next bi weekly meeting with all involved parties.

Awaiting our comments as below.

/////

Did they mentioned some volume for ME ? (just for better understanding if

SX1 or LUX)

Please let us know how many plugs will they load via Itapoa on SX2.

/////

As we can see Aurora is loading via LUX mainly to Yantian and Jebel Ali.

Regarding Jebel Ali should we consider some weekly volume via LUX ?

Dear Tathiana,

Good afternoon \!

Please note that after our bunker revision, they promise us to try to

achieve 1st volume offered with around 120 ctns week including all trades,

so they intend to move 80xR5 (SX1/SX2) and 10xR5(LUX to ME) \+ 10xR5(ANG) \+

10xR5(LUX to SAF) \+ 10xR5)LUX to EUR)

gradually and in case of more volume they will consult us case y case.

 Thank you \!

Happy New Year to all of you and family \!\!\!

Could you please confirm what you mean gradually? When is it expected to

achieve the 120 x R5? What is the minimum volume at the beginning?

We need this kind of information due to the points below

   1\. Special conditions granted: How to monitor the performance and keep

   the agreements

   2\.  AP, what is the volume to be considered to Aurora since the beginning

   3\. Spot business: We need to understand how you will need to work with

Hi Irving and Natan,

Please allow me to enquire about Aurora nomination file.

In \<BD.FRETE\> worksheet, there are final rate agreements as well as other

offers (such as freetime and TT etc) on a port-pair basis. However there is

no volume nomination indication.

Whilst in separate \<ALOCAÇÃO\> worksheet, there are volume indications.

As per email correspondence from Ogawa, understood we would receive around

120 ctns week for all trades offered. Is the volume breakdown same as

column D?

Will customers provide a detailed volume breakdown at port-pair basis?

During previous discussions, we understood that some customers might not be

able to provide detailed volume breakdown at port-pair basis.

Given the case, could you please share how Sales would file the Award

nomination and how the Account Plan is set up? We would appreciate if you

could share this information with us for an enhancement in Award / Filing

Tool development.

Good day Flourance

Thanks for raising this detail this is my perspective of what we may expect

on the future for the accounts as you mention not all the customers give an

award by port pair and not always C-KAM is able to obtain that volume

breakdown from them.

Saying this my opinion regarding award and filling is as follow:

1\. \*Volume/account plan\*: We may need to consider that for volume

commitment we will need to update it by Service/revenue lane same as CVA

option (bellow example from mission which customer only give POD

information but not POL so we input service instead of exact port-pair) so

this cases will be covered if system allow both the register by service

lane or by port \-pairs.

\[image: image.png\]

2\. \*Filling process:\* there is no option but to update port pairs but it

must not require the exact volume for each one to proceed with the filling

into RFA and SC so this way the C-KAM will be able to inform which lanes

are needed to be updated into the contract without having issues if

customer do not give the exact volume by port pair.

We may need to further discuss this in our bi-weekly meetings.

Let me know if this helped you.

Hi Irving,

Regret for my late response.

Well noted that for Volume / Account Plan set up, Sales would either input

the volume commitment by Service Lane (Revenue Lane) or exact port pair

basis.

Please let us discuss the approach internally, on which Award Volume input

by Service Lane (Revenue Lane). In case of any other doubts, please allow

us to contact you / LARHQ colleagues.

Thank you again for your comments which do share as a guidance.

Dear Imai san,

We've been discussing internally about the overall results of SNOW

implementation in LA after almost 3 months and even with so many

improvements in the tool, we still have some concerns about space control

itself:

During this period 9 service lanes were included for parallel operation,

however, project pace has been demanding and even though the

punctual mismatches identified were corrected, we still don't have a

clear/objective visualization of SNOW behavior during full vessel rotation.

Besides that, simulation in editable fields isn't working as expected and

it's quite complicated to manage all required info between all tabs, which

makes Excel still looks more dynamic for SPC daily.

We understand that you're currently in a biz trip, however we'd like to

check a target date in the next weeks to discuss the following

\*1)\* LA SPCs to elect one vessel and analyze the numbers during the whole

rotation to better map numbers mismatch and report it to GHQ // impact: to

suspend Shot 3 until the experiment is finished.

\*2)\* Show some examples of how simulation is used in LA to find suitable

solutions for SNOW

\*3)\* Baplie link to Snow

\*4)\* How to improve dashboards visualization in SNOW to increase analysis

efficiency.

Appreciate your hear your thoughts on this so we have it aligned for the

next fine tune schedule with Munyee.

Dear Isadora,

Thank you for your message.

The project team is aware of the fact that the SNOW has room to improve

further, however, this update was a bit surprising as it's not being

highlighted much at the LA Non-Domi touchpoint meetings. Anyway, we believe

it's necessary to discuss first so that the crucial gaps are identified,

and we will study the mitigating ideas together.

Since the next touchpoint is scheduled early next week, let's utilize the

slot. Your feedback is always valuable to us so we shall review it taking

this opportunity.

Best regards,

## Re: SNOW LA Non-Domi: Project progress review

受信: Wed Nov 15 2023 15:38:36 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Go Imai \<go.imai@one-line.com\>  
Dear Thiago,

Thank you for your message. Let me make comments in blue.

\= \= \=

I discussed briefly with SPC PIC about rollout timeline to capture real

voice ( what's working well vs. bottlenecks),

My perception is that they are concerned about the speed of fulfilling the

entire proposed schedule vs. daily activities.

With the launch of 2 new services (LUX and FLX) they need  to balance

efforts between projects and execution (totally fair) .

Please allow me to evaluate with PIC in LA and back to you.

(DYM): Do you mean that we will just need to review the project schedule

for LA Non-Domi, which means the speed of the rollout is the only issue?

Or, if there are any other issues and concerns the LA team feels, we'd

appreciate it if LA RHQ could elaborate and list up. We'd like to study and

propose proper solutions to the concerns and issues of the LA team.

Ps. Nov 15th will be a holiday in Brazil, our next touchpoint discussion is

scheduled for Nov16th, I will request a postponement to the following week

in order to obtain support information to have a  fruitful conversation.

(DYM): Noted that we will be able to have a fruitful discussion when we

postpone the scheduled meeting to next week. Munyee will check with

Cassandra when to have the catch-up separately. @Munyee Cheong TPV

Dear \*Imai\*-san,

Thanks for your reply.

To be honest it's a combination of accelerating service coverage vs. system

capabilities to manage SPC activities.

The main concern is that the tool is not yet 100% adherent to replace SPC

activities, the perception that the tests are just to align communication

and data validation between OPUS and SNOW, while our  special request is to

speed-up other enhancements (mainly simulation environment) to have a

complete rehearsal in the tool.

Anyway, please allow me to check them this week and give you detailed

feedback.

Best Regards.

## Re: SNOW LA Non-Domi: Project progress review

受信: Thu Nov 23 2023 10:47:38 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Cassandra Peretto \<cassandra.peretto@one-line.com\>  
Hi Imai san,

We had the chance to better discuss Snow project and its current

development/timeline with LATAM SPC team.

Please, allow me to share in advance the results of our conversation for

our fruitful discussion tomorrow during our meeting.

Following in line with what Thiago mentioned before, the main concerns from

our side are:

   \- There are many inconsistencies found in the numbers when comparing

   Snow x Opus x baplie, such as discrepancies in the import numbers, ROB, etc;

   \- In case of port omissions or any other last-minute changes due to

   operational issues, it affects the reliability of the numbers in the

   platform;

   \- The current sync schedule of Snow with Opus does not attend the SPC

   needs to properly monitor the vessels and comply with all the updates;

   \- The simulation tool in the platform is too complex to be handled (with

   many steps involved in different tabs), not to mention that it doesn't

   allow simulations by plugs and move counts (key elements to be considered

   for some LATAM services);

   \- The current goal set for the project, to use the Snow platform just

   for communication alignment and data validation, doesn't make sense at this

   point with other important aspects to be reviewed/corrected yet.

Based on the a/m key items, we don't feel confident with the current

project development, and with the Snow capability to cover the required

validations to control the vessels.

LATAM view is that the main objective would have to be adjusted, aiming to

prioritize the correction of these inconsistencies/remove the roadblocks

before resuming its course. In other words, it's not just a matter of

schedule revision, but how we move forward.

\*LATAM proposal to GHQ:\*

Take a step back, and suspend the shot 2/3 for the time being.

On the other hand, LATAM SPC selects 2 candidate vessels (one for each

coast) to closely monitor them during the whole round voyage, aiming to:

   \- Raise all the inconsistencies found in the numbers and share them with

   GHQ;

   \- Request enhancements \- features that SPC must have in the platform to

   control the vessels like it has been done in the offline controls;

   \- And, have the chance to understand the Snow capabilities in terms of

   SPC (operations control) to attend to the initial objective of the project

   \= replace the offline Excel control with the online platform

\*What's expected from GHQ:\*

We would like to count on GHQ efforts to concentrate the attention on

improving the platform and the UI instead of focusing on the current shots

to expand the Snow coverage.

Last, we want to reinforce that LATAM is willing to receive directions from

GHQ in case there's anything that could be improved on our side along the

way and in favor of the project development.

We can discuss this further in our meeting today. Thanks.

Best Regards,

Please find the discussion summary & action items as per yesterday's call:

1 \- There is no outstanding SR at the moment. LA RHQ to share the

discrepancies finding during“new trial” later.

2 \- Some data is not updated to OPUS timely (SPC still refers to terminal

list/edi file). These data may not be able to reflect if we only based on

OPUS as the source. LA RHQ to advise on what other data are required for

adjustment in SNOW.

3 \- After platform replacement, we may review the enhancement point/design

of the new data platform; whether it can allow some on-demand triggers for

data sync/improve data refresh frequency.

4 \- To plan a ‘refreshment’ session with LA RHQ to highlight the key

features necessary before the “new trial” starts. \*(Proposed to schedule on

30 Nov, 8-9pm SGT | 9-10am BRT)\*

5 \- LA RHQ is aligned on the objective and agile approach of SNOW.

6 \- To plan for the “new trial” activity:Based on the outcome of the “new

trial” to re-align/plan the rollout schedule. \*(Appreciate if you can

confirm details for the trial)\*

   \- Candidate service lanes – 2 services; 2 vessels

   \- Feedback method: Google sheets – To records the discrepancies and

   finding

   \- Approach preferred: Online touchpoint, weekly – To discuss on

   discrepancies and finding

   \- Activity time frame of this activity: 2 months/8 weeks

   \- When to kick start: After the refreshment session

7 \- Based on the outcome from the new trial, we may re-align on the

schedule adjustment.

Dear Munyee (LAT SPC team to note),

good day

Thanks for sharing the summary and the ppt (per attached).

Please, find my comments in magenta for items 4-6.

4 \- To plan a ‘refreshment’ session with LA RHQ to highlight the key

features necessary before the “new trial” starts. \*(Proposed to schedule on

30 Nov, 8-9pm SGT | 9-10am BRT)\*

LAT: We are in agreement with the proposed date and time: THU \- Nov 30 at

9-10 am (BRT). Per our chat, I might not be able to join next week due to a

F2F meeting scheduled in São Paulo office, but the SPC team should join.

And then I'll watch the recording later. Please, can you send the meeting

invitations?

5 \- LA RHQ is aligned with the objective and agile approach of SNOW.

LAT: That's correct. For the new trial plan, we should document all the

inconsistencies found, and enhancements requests with examples in the "S

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ahmXtlZynrAF0pdBZIuo9lGNJMO5ige7mjR3vmh\_jU/edit\#gid=1237175105\>now

file.

6 \- To plan for the “new trial” activity: Based on the outcome of the “new

trial” to re-align/plan the rollout schedule. \*(Appreciate if you can

confirm details for the trial)\*

   \- Candidate service lanes – 4 services; 4 vessels (Obs.: I'm

   double-checking with LAWC SPC if we should keep the 3 indicated

   vessels, just in case. If any changes, I'll let you know by next week).

      \- LAEC: Cape Artemisio 2344W/E (PETT2344)

      \- LAWC: GPX Mizar 2322S/N (MZRT2322); MAR NYK SILVIA 0409E/W

   \- Feedback method: Google sheets – To records the discrepancies and

   finding

      \- Per a/m, the idea is to document all the inconsistencies found, and

      enhancements requests with examples in the "S

      file for fruitful discussions in our touch point call.

   \- Approach preferred: Online touchpoint, weekly – To discuss on

   discrepancies and finding

      \- Initially, we would like to counteroffer a bi-weekly call instead,

      but the SPC team confirmed they are going to update the G-sheet

on a weekly

      basis. This way, we can use this file as a source of communication until

      our bi-weekly touch point.

   \- Activity time frame of this activity: 2 months/8 weeks

      \- Confirmed. In other words, from the 1st wk of Dec/2023.

   \- When to kick start: After the refreshment session

      \- Confirmed

7 \- Based on the outcome of the new trial, we may re-align on the schedule

adjustment.

Noted with thanks, and LAT is in agreement to proceed like that.

## LATAM target accounts for the Conversion/Pricing tool in FY23

受信: Tue Sep 05 2023 06:12:38 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Cassandra Peretto \<cassandra.peretto@one-line.com\>  
Hi Nakai san & Eagle-X team,

As requested in our last touchpoint session, we were supposed to share the

expected release date of the first LAT tenders that we would like to quote

through Eagle-X.

Sorry for my belated reply on this, but we didn't send it earlier since we

were revising the target accounts with LA SYM.

After rediscussing it internally, and considering the timeframe, we would

like to propose the accounts below as our target tenders to be quoted

through the conversion/pricing tool in the production environment (go-live)

for the FY23.

You'll see in column P that they should be released by the customers

from Oct/23 to Mar/24. In this sense, Marketing also has time to discuss

the Route Portfolio Simulation with the account managers for these ones.

Please, can DYM comment on whether this is feasible to be considered or not?

Kindly let us know if any other information is needed from our end.

Thanks.

Hi Cassandra,

Apologies for the belated.

Thank you for selecting Eagle-X accounts from Oct onwards on tender release

basis.

We have no objection to your proposal and will support you as much as

possible.

If my understanding is correct, those accounts should be onshore

account(local BCO) or TITAN account.

On top of that, we would like to update our Eagle-X scope in FY24.

During our visit to LA, our scope was onshore and TITAN account but our top

management requested us to expand our scope of Eagle-X to standardise

tender process as much as possible within FY24.

Therefore, we will handle offshore account through Eagle-X from Nov onwards

on tender release month basis which we have agreed with GCSM fundamentally.

Having said that, we would like to avoid huge risk by handling tremendous

account suddenly so we will verify whether E2E process (from initial check

in to consolidation) as per strong request from GCSM.

Please see below for your reference.

Suppose it should be better to have follow up session to share some points

on top of that with your end.

If you are available, can we have a session next week ?

Hi Nakai san,

Please, find my comments in blue:

Thank you for selecting Eagle-X accounts from Oct onwards on tender release

basis.

We have no objection to your proposal and will support you as much as

possible.

Noted with thanks. Should we expect to receive any green light from DYM

confirming that the tool is ready in the production environment for us to

start working on these selected accounts when the time comes?

Please, kindly advise if you need anything else from our side for the

proper arrangements. A fine-tuning session with all the stakeholders (LA

SYM, Tender, Marketing, and even BPIT) would be helpful for the alignments

prior to the go-live.

If my understanding is correct, those accounts should be onshore

account(local BCO) or TITAN account.

Your understanding is correct.

On top of that, we would like to update our Eagle-X scope in FY24.

During our visit to LA, our scope was onshore and TITAN account but our top

management requested us to expand our scope of Eagle-X to standardise

tender process as much as possible within FY24.

Therefore, we will handle offshore account through Eagle-X from Nov onwards

on tender release month basis which we have agreed with GCSM fundamentally.

We have no objection to that for the FY24. For this second half of FY23

though, we initially would like to commit and move forward with these 17

target accounts for LATAM (per sent in my previous msg).

This would give us time to understand how it goes and gain experience with

the tools and the process itself. Please, let us know DYM's thoughts on

that.

Having said that, we would like to avoid huge risk by handling tremendous

account suddenly so we will verify whether E2E process (from initial check

in to consolidation) as per strong request from GCSM.

I understand, and no problem with that. I can provide the rate sheets for

the Offshore tenders under LATAM jurisdiction. So, you can start working on

the conversion study for these cases.

When would you like to receive that?

I assume that the HK Tender team will provide the ones for the GKA Offshore

tenders, correct? So, I would only have to worry about the BCO tenders for

the RKA, LKA, and ONECare accounts.

Suppose it should be better to have follow up session to share some points

on top of that with your end.

If you are available, can we have a session next week ?

Next week we (LA SYM and Tender) have a call scheduled (on Sep 11th) with

LATAM Marketing teams to align some topics related to EagleX.

Please, allow me to discuss this with them and take the opportunity to

check their availability for a touchpoint with DYM. I'll revert after that.

Thanks again.

Hi Nakai san,

Please, find my comments in blue:

Thank you for selecting Eagle-X accounts from Oct onwards on tender release

basis.

We have no objection to your proposal and will support you as much as

possible.

Noted with thanks. Should we expect to receive any green light from DYM

confirming that the tool is ready in the production environment for us to

start working on these selected accounts when the time comes?

Please, kindly advise if you need anything else from our side for the

proper arrangements. A fine-tuning session with all the stakeholders (LA

SYM, Tender, Marketing, and even BPIT) would be helpful for the alignments

prior to the go-live.

(KN) Once you receive FY24 customer tender sheet, please proceed with

Eagle-X process (e.g. Sales to save it into the G folder) without any

additional action and also appreciate if you could share with us that you

receive customer tender sheet for our acknowledgement.

        At the initial stage, we Eagle-X team will support each

stakeholders on a case by case basis.

If my understanding is correct, those accounts should be onshore

account(local BCO) or TITAN account.

Your understanding is correct.

(KN) Noted.

On top of that, we would like to update our Eagle-X scope in FY24.

During our visit to LA, our scope was onshore and TITAN account but our top

management requested us to expand our scope of Eagle-X to standardise

tender process as much as possible within FY24.

Therefore, we will handle offshore account through Eagle-X from Nov onwards

on tender release month basis which we have agreed with GCSM fundamentally.

We have no objection to that for the FY24. For this second half of FY23

though, we initially would like to commit and move forward with these 17

target accounts for LATAM (per sent in my previous msg).

This would give us time to understand how it goes and gain experience with

the tools and the process itself. Please, let us know DYM's thoughts on

that.

(KN) Basically, have no objection to focusing on 17 target accounts you

shared first.

        Regarding offshore tender process, as you can imagine, Sales will

not conduct initial check-in / check list and offshore team (OMMC or WNS)

will do instead.

        Pricers will have more opportunity to offer rate through Eagle-X

process by handling offshore tender but believe they will get used to

pricing tool soon handling some Go-Live tender accounts.

        We will elaborate on the offshore tender process at the next

touchpoint.

Having said that, we would like to avoid huge risk by handling tremendous

account suddenly so we will verify whether E2E process (from initial check

in to consolidation) as per strong request from GCSM.

I understand, and no problem with that. I can provide the rate sheets for

the Offshore tenders under LATAM jurisdiction. So, you can start working on

the conversion study for these cases.

When would you like to receive that?

I assume that the HK Tender team will provide the ones for the GKA Offshore

tenders, correct? So, I would only have to worry about the BCO tenders for

the RKA, LKA, and ONECare accounts.

(KN) Masuda san / Yuesheng is visiting WNS today to conduct a rollout

session as WNS is looking after RKA, LKA and ONE Care.

        We will contact you separately in order for WNS to

deepen understanding of conversion operations using some accounts as trial.

        If you have good RKA/LKA accounts under LA contract as trial,

please share them with us. (will intend to select 1 or 2 accounts from each

RHQ)

Suppose it should be better to have follow up session to share some points

on top of that with your end.

If you are available, can we have a session next week ?

Next week we (LA SYM and Tender) have a call scheduled (on Sep 11th) with

LATAM Marketing teams to align some topics related to EagleX.

Please, allow me to discuss this with them and take the opportunity to

check their availability for a touchpoint with DYM. I'll revert after that.

(KN) Noted. WIll await further update.

Thanks again.

Dear Eagle X team,

I had a catch-up with Cassandra to discuss all the points raised in the

last meeting, and I see that there were too many points to discuss and

still some pending that weren't covered during the meeting.

With that being said, I suggest we arrange a\* Bi-weekly catch-up with LA

MKTG/Tender/BPIT and GHQ, \*at least until we have the process well

established after the go live.

Please could you consider for us to start having the catch-ups from the

first week of October?

Thank you, best regards.

Can you please look at \*a) to c)\* and put comments on action items by us

and questions from LA RHQ.

Considering Go Live tender comes soon, LA Mktg is requesting us to have a

refresher session of Pricing tool as well as EUA and review Route Portfolio

simulation.

To avoid the SODIAAL case, I would say that we should conduct training

session before Go Live starts.

\*Mktg\*: Please, can you confirm if you are okay to redo the UAT for the a/m

refresh in the pricing tool and prepare for the go live.

\#31 / 34 / 44: Updated as Completed.

month from M11 onwards (per the list below)?

If so, is it possible to also update the period that we are extracting the

customer's liftings to be as 2023/M04 \- 2023/M09 instead? This way,

Hola Cassandra,

Thank you. Whilst awaiting MKTG team's comments, please view our comments

as EagleX.

\#31 / 34 / 44: Updated as Completed.

\*CP:\*

\#31: please note that in Eagle X portal we still see an inconsistency

between the test and go live forms:

Test: Initial Check In/Simplified format forms \= v46

Go Live: Initial Check In/Simplified format forms \= v45

EagleX: We updated v45 to Live environment this week, please consider Live

environment is the same as Test environment.

At the same time, during pre-conversion study stage, we need to use the

tools in Test environment to enhance some existing backlogs, therefore the

version number of Test environment is a little bit different. Nonetheless

please consider v45 in Live environment is the latest and rest assured that

we will always update to the latest in Live environment.

\#34: I've updated it back as a "pending" item. Still waiting for Masuda

san's reply to the message below.

\*"LATAM \- 2024 BCO Tender Calendar (Updated Onshore x Offshore tenders &

Missing/Updated tender formats)"\*

Appreciate if you can check and reply to that asap.

EagleX: Masuda san will respond separately.

\#44: We still have no access to the Status List \- Go live version. Please,

could you help to double-check it?

I appreciate it if you can grant access to all the LATAM stakeholders here

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h-1n0GIXKmK3dqhAqG0jhPfygkTt8oAM6XZQJJWT8x0/edit\#gid=0\>

Hi Flourance,

As per our talk over the chat, since the intention is to focus on the

pricing team for a content refresh, we agreed that you'll prepare the Pricing

Tools using the current Converted ONE Format (without the Initial Check In

/ Sales Checklist).

Please, kindly advise as soon as the Pricing tool is ready for both UATs,

so the Marketing teams can start working on them.

In regards to the remaining topics answered by you, please see my comments

below.

\#31, \#34:

\*CP:\* Noted with thanks.

\#44:

\*CP:\* I confirm access to the folders (1) and (2).

Please find Pricing Tool for Nippon Suisan UAT from this folder. \*\*\* Please

Please do not hesitate to approach us should you have any questions or

See you during the refresher session on Tuesday.

Hi Cassandra,

cc Paulo, Tathiana, Tatiane,

As we separately chatted, considering JBS comes in EagleX as Live tender

process, we suspended Pricing Tool UAT for the same.

We intend to share JBS and Aurora live tender pricing tools tomorrow

(Friday 13 Oct), though we might take some time due to the complexity of

JBS tender.

If Pricing Tool refresher session is required on Monday 16 Oct to assist BR

MKTG in the live tender rate offer, please do let us know; we are ready for

the session.

Thank you for your trust and confidence in EagleX Pricing Tools which is

very encouraging to us.🤗

good day

Please, can I follow up on this pricing tool trial (test environment) of

Nippon Suisan account, which was sent on Oct 12th by Flourance?

I would like to confirm/align:

1\) Has the CL Mktg team had the chance to work on this trial tender?

If so, please share the results. If not, please can I confirm if you still

intend to work on that?

2\) With Sugal account, which is the first go-live tender that you are about

to quote in the pricing tool (as agreed last week), please let me know if

you still wish to go ahead with Nippon Suisan trial in addition to that for

your better practice of the tool.

Please, confirm by return. Thanks.

\*Good Afternoon Terada-san,\*

Duly noted with thanks.

Anyhow, we also initiate test from our side with CST team and please allow

us to share some of our comments & insights.

Kindly refer to below items:

1\. EMail Notification was addressed to Pricers, instead of CST

\[image: image.png\]

2\. Some lanes are Tagged as New lanes even though those are under Old lanes.

    This might create confusion to CST and Pricer

\[image: image.png\]

3\. Surcharge Summary was not Auto-generated, this means that we need to

submit it again to Surcharge Team and they need re-create surcharges, right?

    How about for those new lanes, which are Not considered in the

Surcharges creation during R1

\[image: image.png\]

4\. For Confirmation,

Based on conducted Test, seems Location/Trade Mapping was automatically

Retrieved based on R1 Information, but Container Type & Size were NOT.

Please Confirm if we already have this Auto-retrieve function in the R2, or

this is just a coincidence.

\[image: image.png\]

5\. When we click the "9-1) Get Delete Lanes"  it automatically captured the

deleted lanes.

   However, when we try to re-run the conversion tool using the "6-d-3

Delete Formula for Retry", the Lanes generated previously was not refresh

and still remains.

a. we click the below button:

\[image: image.png\]

b. We click "6-d-3 Delete Formula for Retry", to retry the conversion tool

\[image: image.png\]

c. After we generate, Deleted Lanes under Customer Sheet still remains and

was not refreshed.

\[image: image.png\]

Appreciate your kind checking of above scenarios.

Thank you in advance

Dear Ben san

Thank you for sharing your comments & insights regarding R2 test, I respond

below.

Also, I wrote some notes on R2 testing. Please check it out.

\*Answers to your comments & insights\*

1\. In the past, NA had conducted the Initial Check-in with Pricer, and the

previous implementation was still in place. We will make the necessary

adjustments to "CST" in future updates.

2\. By correcting the \#Additional Column in "①Customer Sheet," the issue

will be resolved. (Please refer process explanation)

3\. Surcharge Format is now automatically generated in R2 as well. While

initially, we had considered creating Surcharge Format only for R1, it is

now generated for all Rounds. We will remove the red comment in cell H452,

which was originally included for internal explanation purposes and is no

longer needed.

4\. In general, Location/Trade Mapping is automatically retrieved even in

Round 2\. To check the status of the Conversion Tool, could you please

provide the link?

5\. There is an ongoing bug fix related to this issue. Please bear with us

as we work on resolving it.

\*Notes on R2 test\*

As explained briefly in last week's Conversion Study session, I’d like to

indicate the following information on the R2 Conversion workflow

(differences from R1 Conversion only).

If you have any questions, I would appreciate it if you could let me know.

\*2. Rearrange Additional Columns of the ①Customer Sheet, including the

Due to the addition of new rows in the R2 Customer sheet, Additional Column

in the ①Customer Sheet is misaligned.

We apologize for the inconvenience, Could you please rearrange all this

column (see the Magenta line in the figure below)  .

When the column is properly adjusted, the number in the Control Panel \*"(+)

NEW"\* will match the number of rows added (see the Yellow line in the

figure below).

\[image: image.png\]   \[image: image.png\]

\*3. Click Get Delete Lanes button\*

Finally, click Get Delete Lanes button, and the number in the Control

Panel \*"(-)

DELETE"\* will match the number of rows deleted (see Yellow line in the

figure below).

The deleted rows can be seen by checking the DELETE flag \*"R2DELETE\_001"\* on

the ①Customer Sheet (see Yellow line in the figure below).

\[image: image.png\]  \[image: image.png\]

\*\*What to do if 2\. Rearrange Additional Columns is skipped and 3\. Click Get

Delete Lanes button is executed first\*

Delete any rows containing \*”\!DELETE\_XXX"\* that occurred as a result of

clicking Get Delete Lanes button mistakenly.

Then, \*2. Rearrange Additional Columns\* and \*3. Click the Get Delete Lanes

button\* again.

1点質問なのですが, 既存のStatus listのContract Noが間違っている場合にはどのような修正フローになりますでしょうか？

Pricing teamがこれからContract No等を確認するので、そういった点が結構五月雨で指摘が挙がってきそうな気がしており。。。

よろしくお願い致します。

お世話になっております。

ご連絡ありがとうございます。

Contract Noの修正であれば、Customer MasterシートのO列の値を直接ご修正いただいて問題ございません。

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13JBWJdqp\_CsF387zpq3UbAJ3LceVjSK7eEyaIaRUPjQ/edit\#gid=287714056\&range=O4

注意点として、下記２点がございます。

【１点目】

Customer MasterシートO列のセルが黄色になっている場合は、Contract Noの登録が必要となります。

Contract No 未登録（O列：黄色セル）の場合、 AH列以降に”Done”ではなく、Contract No. が表示されるようになっております。

表示されているContractの情報をPwCチームへご共有いただけますと幸いです。

【２点目】

Contract No以外（Controlling RHQ, Contract office, ★SC/RFA Group Customer

Code, ★SC/RFA Group Customer Name, Sequence No.など）の

値の修正をご希望される際は、ご連絡をいただけますと幸いです。

※具体的には、”Add New Account Data”シートで【Required】となっていない項目については、ご修正いただいて問題ございませんが、

【Required】の項目については、Status List以外のマスターデータやツール内のデータなど修正が必要になります。

そのため、現状ではPwCチームで修正をいたします。

お手数をおかけし大変恐れ入りますが、ご確認のほどよろしくお願いいたします。

Hi Ryan,

Sorry for the late reply.

Thank you very much for setting up the great team. We totally agree with

you.

At the same time, experienced Sodiaal live tender, we feel the following

are the challenges.

1\. Further process optimization (Enable parallel execution with the

Conversion team as much as possible) to shorten the turntime.

2\. Nighttime support to handle peak season

Let us keep discussing with you.

Thanks & Regards,

Kazuki Masuda

Noted, refer to below;

(1) We can proceed with a later meeting at 230-400 for today.

(2) For the accounts, we can agree to use Covestro / Lanxess, however,

please note Covestro's portal will be changed for this year as per advise

from CKAM. so most probably Tender fille will be different.

(3) For The PIC

      Covestro \- Joan Cabanlong

      Lanxess \- Steven Ortega

 \- can we understand that we will simultaneously process both tender?

(4) Touchpoint Meeting, suggest we just have a call after we finish the

test run. And in case, some issue arises, let's create a group chat or a

meeting if needed.

(5) AOB

\- please make sure to advise pricing for the test "live" that they will

process (for awareness). Furthermore, to take this like a live tender' no

dummy input, since they already have last year file.

\- Are we involving all pricer? or you have selected only a few, in this

case we are aware how many we can receive.

\- Can we understand that the address of OMMC GTM was already included?

Thanks and let us know if there are any concerns

\*Good Morning M'Bel,\*

Duly noted below feedback with thanks.

Kindly refer to our comments in blue.

(1) We can proceed with a later meeting at 230-400 for today.

      BD: Noted with thanks

(2) For the accounts, we can agree to use Covestro / Lanxess, however,

please note Covestro's portal will be changed for this year as per advise

from CKAM. so most probably Tender fille will be different.

       BD: Noted with thanks

(3) For The PIC

      Covestro \- Joan Cabanlong

      Lanxess \- Steven Ortega

 \- can we understand that we will simultaneously process both tender?

       BD: Thank you for the PIC assignment.  Yes, your understanding is

correct, we will process these 2 accounts simultaneously.

(4) Touchpoint Meeting, suggest we just have a call after we finish the

test run. And in case, some issue arises, let's create a group chat or a

meeting if needed.

       BD: Noted and we understand your intention.  However, can we set

tentative schedules for the touchpoint?  Because believe we will be needing

CST Team to be in this call as well and currently CST Team is already

handling a couple of LIVE Tenders which they try to prioritize as well.  In

this regard, may we propose to have the below set-up.

      1\. As you noticed, we have set a schedule for the touchpoint meeting

for next week, Can we maintain these schedules? then along the way,

depending on the test progress, we can decide whether we will proceed with

the touchpoint meeting or we cancel it and move it to the  next scheduled

session instead.  In such way, CST can anticipate their schedule and can

prepare or adjust their workloads and priorities.

       2\. Or if you can provide us your preferred date and time for our

reference so that we can adjust accordingly.

       AS for the \*Group Chat\*, we already have hangout space "OMMC E2E

Test" we will continue to use this space for the communication channel of

this offline process.

       We will just add those Involved Pricing Trades PIC and GCSM HKG.

 Please let us know if there are other addresses you want us to include.

(5) AOB

\- please make sure to advise pricing for the test "live" that they will

process (for awareness). Furthermore, to take this like a live tender' no

dummy input, since they already have last year file.

       BD: Noted.  We will send Notification to pricer, via email, put OMMC

in cc for your reference.  Let's us just check the Trades Involved first

for those 2 accounts then we will send email to them accordingly.

\- Are we involving all pricer? or you have selected only a few, in this

case we are aware how many we can receive.

       BD: So far almost all Pricing Trades are onboard now, except for \*NA

Pricing\* Trade.  In our email to pricer, we will try to ask them to confirm

if they can assist to quote so that you will have visibility on how many

trades we are expecting to offer.

\- Can we understand that the address of OMMC GTM was already included?

        BD: The automation enhancement is already working in progress, but

for these test tender, we will ask SYM Pricing Team to manually add OMMC

group addressee to make sure that you are copied-in in all Pricer's

submission.  Let us now if there are other addressee need to be in cc aside

from OMMC Group ADD?

Appreciate your further comments.

Thank you

Hi Nakai san and Flourance,

Good morning.

As highlighted in the HK meeting last week, GCSM tender team centralizes to

We suggest keeping the GCSM tender team as the \*single window\* to maintain

this Pricer PIC List to avoid confusion to the pricing teams.  Currently,

TST and Sales Team based on this live updated file to release off-shore &

on-shore tenders.  We also recommend Eagle X refer to the same file to

## Eagle X GCSM Meeting 30 Aug 23 AM

受信: Wed Aug 30 2023 12:25:38 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Yuesheng Chia \<yuesheng.chia@one-line.com\>  
\*GCSM Meeting Minutes for info.\*

\*1. PRD route \*

At the moment, there is no routing option to Location code for inland

routing and as such there will not be able to capture the cost due to OPUS

constraints; Snapshot is available in Tiger PRISIM but due to system

capacity issue, unable to support more.

\- CHORUS new PRD module project will tackle the huge number of routes and

if it is ok, it will help to cover a larger scope. Timeline for the

project is delayed due to Data Accuracy.

\- New TT Tool will be done via new PRD.

\- Consolidation across the trade and whether to split out or not have any

issue to float the TT information into Eagle X

\- The data size is too big and need to reduce the filesize by considering

eliminating P3;

GSE sentiment: P1 and P2 should be suffice and P3 not required especially

for Ocean Routing

If there are inland requirements, possibly P3 will be required and FE

tenders will be needed

\- TT Tool should have larger route coverage compared with Pricing captured

Tiger snapshot

\- Need to cross check with the OPUS Master setup as some location can only

go to CY and no Door:

i. Need to identify logical routes availability

ii. The runtime is about 47-48hours to generate the TT Tool which is quite

significant runtime.

  \*DYM have yet to add in the missing port pairs

\*2. Data coverage Expansion\*

\- This is required and some routing has been reflected, there will be

gradual increase based on the account tenders.

\- GCSM recommends referring to the Missing Port Pair list based on the live

tenders and to add in those missing datas as the first priority as the TST

team has been reviewing a huge number of tenders.

\- How to identify the actual missing routing especially for the inland

routing options

\- If there is any service, Pricer should proceed to offer any missing lanes

where data information will be retained for further data analysis; Eagle X

Team at the moment tapped into the Conversion Study to collect the Tender

Database. (Once conversion is done, info will be populated in

TenderDB\_Combined\_Only Raw Data value will have the full information to be

massaged)

\- Tender DB excel will be moved into the Google Big Query in the near

future; Masuda san will further discuss with Gozu san and PWC in the coming

week (1st Sept)

\- Eagle X team

\*3. Rates Structure Review Pre-Conversion (inclusive Surcharge information)\*

\- Rate structure checklist format been created and is used by \*OMMC

Surcharge Team (3 members including Ryan with pricing experience \- Draft

database created by them)\*

\- 24 tenders studied and updated format which is almost complete. The more

T\&C reviewed, there are more enhancements needed.

\- As a permanent solution to have these 3 members to do this task.

\- CST will complete the conversion and rates structure review for FY23 data

while FY24 sales will submit new tenders and retrieve the FY23 draft to be

updated for FY24 adjusted/revised structure.

\- Original document to be given visible for Pricers' view and mandate as

the process to read the T\&C summary customer format and summarised

information by OMMC Surcharge team.

\*4. Refresh Eagle X data\*

\- Further discussion will be taken up to improve the refresh rates and

runtime

\*5. Target scope account\*

\- At the moment, only Japan NVO \- NAC will go live, while the rest of the

region will not roll out to NVO yet (only about 30 at the moment); EUA will

not expand to NVO yet

\*6. Pricer List\*

\- Eagle X using Service Scope and any exception list; multiple year

contract quote by different trade, Japan trade is included by Japan Pricer.

\- GCSM also have a pricer list updated from GCSM \--\> OMMC

\-\* Actionable Point: Can review the pricer list discrepancies between Eagle

X and GCSM and have a one single source of truth\*

\*7. Process for Offshore Tender Handling\*

\- CST only conduct Retrieve step; to do vlookup function to capture the TT

info from TT data via the consolidation tool macro button

\- TT Review responsibility still lies with Sales responsibilities

\- Offline discussion between sales/TST with Pricers directly is doable

during the Pricer submission of offer to CST process; which is still in

development/enhancement to add in Sales/TST email Address so that they can

take immediate action.

\- GCSM has a huge concern regarding the process timeline which may disallow

much time for TST to review pricers' offer due to pricers' attitude and

response timeline.

\- Pricers accountability is important and Eagle X team do not encourage any

prefix any info into the Pricing Tool

\-\* Actionable Point: To review if it is necessary to include the preferred

service by pricers so that TT info can be input by sales first and in case

if Pricers change during the final offer, can adjust accordingly. \*

\*8. D\&D concern from GCSM\*

\- There are alot of local practices but customers can't be bothered with

such local practices.

\- GCSM will share the guideline and local practice to be considered by

Eagle X, there is frequent discussion between Pricers and TST where there

is a challenge on how can pricers' offer if it is combined basis and how

will such information be mapped into customer format whether its demurrage

or detention column information.

\*9. Titan accounts (on/offshore) target account\*

\- The target accounts \- we will face issues with

1\. NA control/managed accounts as NA Marketing as they are not onboard yet

while the rest of the marketing scope will be onboarded.

2\. TA lanes where Pricers are managed by NA Marketing team.

\- CIF TP business that are pricers based in Singapore should be manageable

\- Opinion from GCSM that we can continue with the tenders and possibly NA

Marketing can add in their inputs directly to customers' tender bid sheet

while all other onboarded trades can continue with the consolidation \*\*

need to review how to manage the consolidation including out of Eagle X NA

Marketing offers (To understand the as-is process and ensure no overwrite,

possibly validation script logic where there is NA related lanes will

retain as is)

\- Roll out timeline to start from November (Proposal from GHQ) and if need

be delayed, need to do rehearsal from all parties before the actual

Theatre.

\*\*Pre-Rehearsal planning has to be conducted to ensure everyone understands

their R\&R within the process scope including their timeline \- Toyo Tire

will include the Japan Sales but of course Onshore tenders good to have

Sales also see the output info.

\- To setup a focal member as main PIC/SuperUser/Eagle X Ambassador/Eagle X

Champion

\- Three accounts for the E2E trial UAT based on all the involved CIF

marketing team (including all Trades OMMC pricers):

1\. Covestro (to further review the quality if it is ok)

2\. P\&G

3\. Electrolux

\*\*\*Other Notes:\*

1\. The GCSM team is happy with the Pricing Tool as how the process is set

up now that it will be input by the marketing pricing team.

2\. GCSM is onboard to expand the usage of Eagle X.

3\. Award CVA requirement for info flow from upstream to downstream ONE

Force.

4\. Eagle X Contract filing study will be reviewed

Thank you

\*Dear Masuda-san,\*

Allow me to share some updates on the ongoing Conversion study particularly

on JPN and NA target accounts.

\*1. New Enhancement in the Conversion Tool \- Adding the Surcharge Summary

Function on v45-08\*

but they will send us the full enhancement details/functionality separately\*

(waiting for their email on this)\*

Although we are still waiting the full details/explanation of this

enhancement from PWC, we foresee that we have to:

\*a. \*Re-run previous completed conversion \*(under lower version)\* into this

new version in order to capture this major enhancement

\*b.\* Current Conversion study under v45-08 will temporary end up to Sales

Review portion only \*(as per Terada-san's advise yesterday, but we will

further check because it would affect the upcoming E2E testing)\*

\*2.\* As for the existing conversions, we got below updates:

\*  CST \-\* currently working on the JPN Priority Accounts, JPN Target

Accounts and NA Target Accounts

          \- Initially they found some Customer Sheet concerns (eg: RHQ

Templates, Missing RFQ, etc..) which we might need to highlight to sales

for further assistance

            I have requested CST to run through all those target accounts

Customer Sheet folder and provide findings in terms of RFQ Concerns so that

we can highlight it in one shot during the next Trade Meeting

   \*Mr. Nam \-\* encountered some conversion issues with a/c MERCEDES BENZ

which I already checked and resolved yesterday.   Will just further check

with Mr. Nam for the update.

\*   Arlene \- \* encountered some conversion issues with a/c MCDONALDS,

already checked and resolved yesterday.  Just waiting for Arlene update.

\*   Jay \- \*encountered some conversion issues as well which we highlighted

to Terada-san (PWC) for checking.  Still waiting for their update.

  \*Others\* \- conversion is still on going and no major issues encountered

  \*HKG Team \*and \*Ryan\* \- not available due to other meeting

\*Furthermore,\* I have a separate discussion with CST in order to set plans

and timeline for the Completion of those JPN & NA Target accounts

generation.  And we have come-up with below plan/target:

\*1. We set the following conversion priority\*

    a. JPN Priority accounts which you have set target completion by 18

Sept 2023

    b. JPN Target Accounts

    c. NA Target Accounts

    d. Re-generation of Old Version to the Latest version (those completed

tender under v44 and below)

\*2. Timeline of Completion\*

For the JPN and NA Target Accounts \- total of 214 accounts

\- we are targeting to complete conversion by 18 Sept 2023 (subject to

Customer Sheet availability)

\- 2 accounts per day / per CST PIC

\*Preparations:\*

a. Have request CST to run through the ALL Customer Sheet  Folders to

identify if any concern on the RFQ Sheet so that we can highlight it to

Sales in one shot \- target feedback by COB, today 30 Aug.

b. We have set a separate discussion schedule daily 4:30 pm onwards \- until

18 Sept to discussion any encountered concerns

c. CST will provide development update to your side on a daily basis

not as much for China

\- Sales concerns point to having one single source of truth and see how to

better provide the dataset information to Sales; possibly to be included in

ONE Force

\- Issue from sales to open up to share tender information due to numerous

tedious work from GCSM processes (Focus on the CVA to be included into ONE

Force by all sales except for ONE CARE)

\- is it possible to enforce sales to fully use Eagle X in a long term

basis.

\- Contract Filing:

1\. Tiger filing is not well liked as one file requires 30 mins to file, it

is tough for countries to manage.

2\. Long Term contract filing will be utilised for filing, for the Short

\- Japan has already decided to embark into Eagle X, country management

already supportive and roll out to inform SALES to use Eagle X despite

the functional group they will be able to provide their fullest support

\*Actionable pointers\*

\- EAS feedback that Tiger has shared all tenders to use Tiger but in actual

(not just on Eagle X) and to do training for Eagle X

(There are much more NVOs NAC which is not captured under the GCSM Calendar)

\- To roll out to inform Sales to provide the NVO \- NACs account for Eagle X

team for our review

\- To further discuss how to organise the tender scope structure

\- EAS Countries Eagle X Ambassador will help to roll out to the countries,

## Eagle X \- Simplified Format改善に関するご提案

受信: Tue Aug 29 2023 12:17:30 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: "Shodai Kashiwazaki (JP)" \<shodai.kashiwazaki@pwc.com\>  
増田さん

お世話になっております。柏崎です。

Simplified Format Creationの現状の問題点とその改善に関してご相談させてください。

現行の仕様では、「Simplified Format (Y/N)」フラグが"Y"の場合にのみSimplified Formatを作成することができます。

しかし、現行のG-Formの仕様ではSimplifiedフラグが"Y"のCustomerに対しSimplifiedを作成できないSequenceが選択できてしまい、選択して作成フローを進めた場合にエラーになります。

【例：Simplified Format作成までのStep】

Step1. Regionの選択

Step2. Group Customerの選択

Step3. Seqenceの選択

このとき、Status Listで"G-JP123456\_JPTEST"というCustomerのseq01のみ「Simplified Format

(Y/N)」フラグが"Y"であった場合に、

Step3でseq02を選択してしまうと、Simplified Formatが作成されずエラーとなってしまいます。

G-FormからはどのCustomerでSimplified Formatが作成できるのか、ユーザー側で判断することができない状態となっております。

この問題を解決するために、以下の2つの改善案を検討しています。

\*改善案1:\*

現行のステップを廃止し、"Simplified Format

(Y/N)"フラグが"Y"の顧客のみを「G-JP123456\_JPTEST\_seq01」という表示でG-FormのDropDownListに表示します。

ただし、これにより選択肢が増える場合にはDropDownList内が膨大になるという課題があります。

\*改善案2:\*

"Simplified Format (Y/N)"フラグの値にかかわらず、どの顧客でもSimplified Formatを出力できるようにします。

これにより、特定のステップを選択する必要がなくなります。

どちらの改善案がより適切か、または他にも良い方法があるかについて、ご意見をお聞かせいただければ幸いです。

## Surchargeシートの件

受信: Tue Aug 29 2023 11:21:23 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Ai Sakuma \<ai.sakuma@one-line.com\>  
大塚さん、増田さん

先日はSurchargeシートのご説明ありがとうございました。

今期のSurchargeシートは「荷主が何を求めているのか」のみ表現するためのもの。と理解しました。

一方Onshore TenderはOffshore

Tenderと異なり、TSTが作成しているような表(左：荷主Request、右：営業の意思)がありません。

よって、従来通りであればメールに記載し、Eagle-Xを通す場合はChecklistに記載するものと思っておりました。

折角Eagle-Xを通すのに、Conversion後に営業の意思をメールでベタ打ちしていては勿体ない気がするので一つ提案です。

今期営業の意思を伝える定型Format化は無理であっても、Checklistにもう1枚シート(free

text)を追加し、FY23で営業からPricerへメールにベタ打ちした内容を

国語のまま入力&マスターデータ化し、FY24本番でその情報をRetrieveさせるのはいかがでしょうか？

仲井さん、増田さん、

こちらはお戻りの木曜に議論させていただければと思いますが、個人的には大枠ONE-Jのご提案にフォローする形で検討するのがいいのかなと考えております。

（方法論としてメールを貼り付けさせるのがいいのかはちょっとわかりませんが）

先日の会議で、元々”Checklist"とは何を定義するものなのか（顧客要望条件そのもの？あるいはそれを咀嚼したSalesの意志も踏まえた条件？）、という結構大事なポイントが抜け落ちていたと理解しており、これを機に整えられればと。

個人的には基本Checklist・Surcharge

Conversion共に、原則は顧客指定の条件を体現するものと位置づけ、それに加えてSalesの意志やPricerへの申し送りがある場合はそれを混ぜずに補足する方がいいかなと思っておりますが、お戻り後また議論させてください。

仲井さん、大塚さん、増田さん

お疲れ様です。

9/15～9/25にかけてPre-Conversion説明会を開催し、Surchargeシートに関して営業からFeedbackを頂きましたのでご報告いたします。

・Surcharge条件が全トレード共通の場合、Pre-Conversion済のSurchargeシートで問題なし

一方、以下のようなケースの場合、Surchargeシートに反映できていない。できない？

・国によりincl / sub が異なる

・customized BAFだが、実質OFTに込々 (CANON, TOYOTA)

・COMMODITYやTERM毎にSurcharge構成が異なる

・特殊取り決めあり (北米シャーシ代込み、DROP OFF込みなど)

Surchargeシートを作成する上で「荷主リクエストをまず国語に置き換える」とのことでしたが、改めて粒々化する前の「国語の置換」がいかに重要か痛感しました。

そこで、以下提案させていただきたく。

荷主から入手する「T\&C」はONE言語に置き換えてまとめる作業が必要になるので、フォーマットや項目を決めて「Open T\&C

Summaryに営業が直接入力する」のはどうか。

Surchargeのみならず、F/Tや特殊取り決め情報なども「Open T\&C

Summary」に盛り込めると荷主リクエストが全網羅できると思いますので、別途打ち合わせさせてください。

横から補足させてください。

本件については下記の通り営業側からもコメントがありましたので共有させて頂きます。

・T\&Cフォームが統一されていて営業が必要に応じて入力するパターンも選択できる方が

分かりやすく必要事項を盛り込みやすいのではないか。

・PricerのトレードによりT\&Cへの表現方法(チャージやPUDO等の言い方)が異なる場合があり、

どれかのトレードに統一するのか、またはトレード別に作成しなくてはならないのか。

\*増田さん\*、

お疲れ様です。

仲井さん、増田さんお二人にたがわず、いよいよ私も首が回らなくなっており取り急ぎメールで本件の見解インプットさせて頂きます。(金曜日もちょっと別途会議に招集される可能性があり）

本Japanからの提案はSurchargeの国語の起こしをOMMCのRyanチームの代わりにやってくれるものと理解しており、基本的には乗っかってしまっていいのかなと思います。

一方で、あくまでConversionすべき内容は「顧客条件である」というポイントをONEの言語に変換する際もブラさないように徹底してもらう必要はあるかと思います。

（意思ごめ＝Sales Intentionであり、ここで国語に変換するときに意思が入ってしまうと余計に混乱を生む）

Formatについては既存のTSTのもので概ね網羅されていると思いますのでそれを基本そのまま使うということでよいかと。

（もちろん足らざるがあればJP側に追加してもらえればいいと思います、たぶんこのプロセスはJapan以外には発生しない、というかやってもらえないのではと想像するので）

最後に、「以下のような場合は反映できない？」となっている点ですが基本的には国ごとの差異であれCommの差異であれトリガーになるColumnがConversion

tool上で存在していれば反映は可能です。

ただ、2点目のCustomized BAFだけどOFT蹴りこみの場合は同表現するかは決めてRyanにガイドしてあげる必要はあると思います。

\*仲井さん、\*

TOYOTA、CANONの例として指摘のあるCustomized BAFかつOFT蹴りこみパターンですが、Pricing

toolではあくまでCutomized BAFとして認識したうえで最終Add

onを行うというイメージで理解に齟齬ないでしょうか？であればSurchargeとしては基本的にFixed扱いとして起こしてもらい、国語のRemarkでOFTに最終的には蹴りこみ、といれてもらうのが正しい気がしていますが、為念目線合わせできればと思います。

ご理解の通りです。

Customizes BAFについてはFixed surcharge扱いにしてもらい、実際のFixed amountをincl/sub

やはりみなさん苦手意識(というか何もやってないが、面倒な思いが残っている)がある中で、中井さん直々にFY24はLong

Term全てのonboardingを目指すと言って頂いています。

全体の流れについて、会議参加者の同意は得られましたが、一部不在となった方々がいましたので、来週火曜日に別のセッションを予定します。

そこで同意が得られれば、再来週のどこかで営業全体へ説明会を開始します。

引き続き準備進めて参ります。

以下、ご共有頂きまして有難うございます。

ManagementからのLong

term全てをEagle-X対象にするという力強いお言葉と同時に、GHQ側でもツール（データ制度も含めて）およびプロセスをしっかり決めないといけないというプレッシャーを感じております。

当方もご共有頂きましたスケジュールに合わせて、やるべき事をしっかり確認して進めていきたいと思います。

引き続き宜しくお願い致します。

佐久間さんの質問に関する回答を頂ければ幸いです。

(既に回答頂いていたらすみません。。。)

別件ですが、明日営業全体へ第一回の説明会を行います。若干内容は変わるかもしれませんが、参考までに資料を共有します。

極力シンプルな説明+直近で具体的に何をしなければならないのか、この２点に絞っています。

FY23 customer formatは８月はじめに、Eagle Game Plan用のpipelineデータは８月末にお渡しできるよう進めます。

遅くなってしまいすみません。

Unworkableの対象ですが、現在JPのTender（Simplifiedを除く）でStatus

listにUploadされているのが92件で、そのうち下記の5件が現在のUnworkableの対象になっております。

\[image: image.png\]

ただし、こちらは今年の2月3月前にConversion studyをしたものなので、改めて最新のToolでWorkableにならないかはEagle

Xチームの方で確認させていただければと考えております。

よろしくお願い致します。

また、カレンダーを更新しました。大きな流れ、日程はこれまでと変更ありませんが、微調整を入れて整理しました。

ご連絡頂きまして有難うございます。

ONEJへ伺う日程は2週間程後ろ倒しのwk41という事で、承知致しました。

また日程が近づいてきましたら、日本でのスケジュール（東京→名古屋→大阪等）を調整させて頂ければと存じます。

Filingも含めたEnd to Endについてですが、FY24内で何かしらのツールが作成出来ればと考えております。

まずは上流工程のconversion / pricing toolの品質を担保しないと下流工程にも影響が出ますので、現在はそちらを優先しておりますが、

Filing processにおいても決して諦めている訳では御座いませんので。

どのタイミングでlaunchできるかという事は明確に出来ませんが、出張時には何かアップデート出来ればと考えております。

FY23カスタマーフォーマットですが、以下ファイル１つを追加しました。

こちら、今後営業からこれも追加でありました、とあった場合、そのままフォルダーへ保存するだけで大丈夫でしょうか。

それとも、別のフォルダーにするなりした方がよいですか？

格納ご連絡ありがとうございます。

1点ご確認なのですが、現在の最新のJPのTenderの一覧のリストをお持ちだったりしないでしょうか？

＊現在のEagle XのStatu listは2月・3月のJP tenderは最新かと思いますが、Early bird等は正しくないように見えます。

今のEagle X Status listではTenderシートありの顧客が100件弱です。他にSimplified

formatのケースはたくさんありますが。

Tenderシートのフォルダには全件シートをおいていただいていると思いますが、CSTがPreconversionをするにあたってG-customer

codeやContract noが整理されたStatus list→Eagle

Xフォルダで作業という流れが必要なことから一覧の整理が急務となっております。

お手数ですが、ご確認お願いいたします。

よろしくお願い致します。

以下、Tender listのご共有有難うございます。

別件で本日のweekly MTGに参加できませんでしたので、1点確認させてください。

増田さんよりNVO NACのconversion/Pricingが話題に挙がったと来ておりますが、ONEJのTender

listのNACの名寄せは全て完了されてますか。

conversionは問題無さそうですが、名寄せがOKなアカウントでpricing tool → reverse

conversionまで可能か検証しておきたいと思いまして。

何か名寄せが完了したNAC（複数のNVO)をご教示頂けますか。

宜しくお願い致します。

PwCの佐野です。いつもお世話になっております。

いただいたJPリストについて、整理をして、Status Listに追加するための準備を進めています。

ボリュームが多く、整理に時間がかかるため、五月雨となり申し訳ありませんが、整理できたところから確認をさせてください。

今回は、以下の表の②(JPリストにあり、Status ListにないAccount)について確認をさせてください。

Status List

あり なし

JPリスト あり ① ②

なし ③ ④

\*確認させていただきたい内容\*

   \- Customer Name, Customer Code、Tender Monthが同じでContractが異なる場合にContract

   Noをマージして1行だけ登録としてもいいでしょうか？

   以下、詳細となります。

   ②は、全部で2,757件ありました。そのうち、511件は、次のサンプルのように、Customer Name, Customer

   Code、Tender Monthが同じで、Contract Noが異なるものでした。

   \[image: image.png\]

   この場合、Contract Noを "TYOB00111A, TYOB00108A,

   TYOB01899A"として、1行だけ登録しようと思いますが、問題ないか確認させてください。

   登録するイメージ

次は、②の2,246件(=2,757-511)について整理を進めていきます。

以上、よろしくお願いします。

細かい点ですが、現在11月・12月受領予定のTenderを調べていていくつか確認させてください。

１）KOMERIのCustomer codeが連番で入ってしまっているのですが、こちらは間違いですかね？

\[image: image.png\]

２）例えばStart monthが11月のStart Yearのものが2022,2023,2024の3種類ありまして、

MAZDAの2024年の11月とかは2023年11月の間違いですかね？見た感じ2023の11月のデータはないようなので。

\[image: image.png\]

また、2022のものは基本的に2023にも入っているという理解であってますでしょうか？

今回のターゲットとしては2023年11月\~2024年4月くらいかシーズンかと思いますが、

2022のものはConverion studyやEagle X folderの対象とするべきかどうかご確認いただけないでしょうか。

よろしくお願い致します。

PwCの佐野です。いつもお世話になっております。

JPリストについて、本日15分程度で、Qucickに確認をさせていただきたいのですが、可能でしょうか？

以下の2点を確認させていただきたいです。

   \- JPリストにあってStatusListにないTenderについて

      \- BCO：

      523件あります。JPリストにGroup Customer Codeがないため、増えている可能性があると考えていますが、Group

      Customer Codeでまとめることが可能か確認させてください。

      \- NVO：

      997件あります。Tenderが同じでNAC違いのものをまとめて登録が可能かを確認させてください。こちらもGroup Customer

      Codeでまとめることが可能か確認をさせてください。

以上、よろしくお願いします。

お疲れ様です。

以下青字の通り回答させていただきますので、ご確認いただけますと幸いです。

１）KOMERIのCustomer codeが連番で入ってしまっているのですが、こちらは間違いですかね？

→ コメリの連番については誤入力となり、正しくはJP106757となりますので、データを訂正させていただきます。

２）例えばStart monthが11月のStart Yearのものが2022,2023,2024の3種類ありまして、

MAZDAの2024年の11月とかは2023年11月の間違いですかね？見た感じ2023の11月のデータはないようなので。

→  紛らわしく大変恐縮ですが、"Start Year (yyyy)"の項目については Contract Start Year (≠ Tender

Start Year)となりますため、

Mazdaはじめ、"Start Year 2024"のデータに関しては、直近の2023年11月 Tender

Releaseとして認識頂けますと幸いです。

       2022のものは基本的に2023にも入っているという理解であってますでしょうか？

今回のターゲットとしては2023年11月\~2024年4月くらいかシーズンかと思いますが、

2022のものはConverion studyやEagle X folderの対象とするべきかどうかご確認いただけないでしょうか。

→ "Start Year 2022" のデータについては、Contract Start Year

2022より上書きされていないことが背景となっておりますが、

"Start Year 2023 or 2024"のレーンとは重複しておりませんので、Converion studyやEagle X

## NAアカウントのTender release monthに関してのご回答

受信: Fri Aug 25 2023 11:09:06 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: "Tamaki Horii (JP)" \<tamaki.horii@pwc.com\>  
増田さん

いつも大変お世話になっております。

依頼していただいていた、NAアカウントでStatus ListのTender release monthが空欄になっている件ですが、

Status List(Tender release month)とNAリスト(2022/2023 Bid Received

Date)の値のあり/なし、

双方に値があった場合、それらの一致/不一致を調査しました。

調査の結果、以下の画像のような結果となりました。

（こちらのファイル

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dtrCgngbf2pdlVraZUy\_bL6\_CwXKc6FQR2Dd7KxXOko/edit\#gid=1830802351\>

のSheet1が分析結果、Sheet2が分析データとなっております）

こちらに表の内訳ですが、

・Status List-available data / No data…Status listにおけるTender release

monthの情報の有無

NAリスト-available data / No data…NAリストにおける"2022/2023 Bid Received

Date"（AC列）の情報の有無

（＊AC列が空欄の場合,それに比較的近い日付と考えられる"Round 1Due Date(AE列の値も含めております）。

上記分析結果を踏まえて、以下の対応とご依頼事項があります。問題があればお知らせください。

\<PwCで対応\>

・75件

・33件

\<ご依頼事項\>

・41件

・191件

・75件

Status ListとNAリストの双方に記載あり。しかしStatus ListとNAリストでmonthが異なるもの

→NAから頂いたMonthを正としてStatus Listの値をNAリストの値で登録し直します

・33件（こちらの33件が今回ご依頼いただいた部分です）

 Status Listには記載がなく、NAリストには記載あり

→NAリストの値をStatus Listに登録します

・41件

NAリストに記載なし

→追加でNAの担当者の方に追加でrelease dateの情報を依頼する以外に、以下の選択肢も考えられますが、この点については検討が必要かと思います。

①９件はStatus ListのTender release monthの記載があるため、そちらを据え置く

②"2022/2023 Bid Received Date"（AC列）、"Round 1Due Date(AE列）

がなくとも画像のように他の日付が入力されているものが8件あるため、近しいと思われる日付を採用する

＊ただ、現状この２つの選択肢を採用しても空欄になってしまうものが25件あります

・191件

今回ご依頼頂いたrelease dateとは別件にはなりますが、現在191件がStatus

Listに未登録のため、こちらは必要な情報を全て埋めていただいたものから順次Status Listに追加して参ります。

以上、お忙しい中誠に恐縮ですが、ご確認をお願いいたします。

いつもお世話になっております。

ご対応ありがとうございます。

いろいろ整理いただいているのかと思いますが、内容がよくわからず。。。

特にこないだNA calendarの差分を洗い出して我々の方でGコードを付与してStatus

listにUploadが完了したと思っていたのですが、なぜ191件未登録なのでしょうか。

お手数ですが、EUA側のUpdate内容も含めて、来週お時間いただいてご説明をお願いできないでしょうか。

よろしくお願い致します。

いつもお世話になっております。ご返信が遅れ大変申し訳ございません。

NAリストの新規アカウント追加の件ですが、

8月16日時点でNAリストに必要な情報がすべて埋まっていた117件についてはStatus Listに登録しましたが、

それ以降に新たに情報を入力いただいたアカウントは、まだ追加できておりませんでした。

情報更新を確認できておらず、大変申し訳ございません。

現在必要情報がすべて埋まっているアカウントについては、速やかに追加いたします。

また、NAリストを確認していたところ、必要情報が埋まっていないものがいくつかございましたので、

確認次第、整理して追ってご連絡させていただきます。

また、お忙しい中大変恐縮ですが、Tender release monthとEUAのUpdate内容について、

直接ご説明する機会を設けさせていただければと思います。

大変申し訳ございませんが、こちらがMTGを設定できるのが金曜になってしまうため、来週の前半でお時間いただければと思います。

シンガポール時間で来週月曜9:00\~11:00、13:00-15:00.来週火曜11:00-12:00、14:00-15:00でMTG設定可能ですが、ご都合如何でしょうか？

何卒よろしくお願いいたします。

ご準備頂きありがとうございます。

10時からの会議では下記3のイメージであるプロセス、ツールのデモ部分を最初に話したのちに、全体構成の目線合わせ（流れ、時間想定、役割分担、等）を実施できればと考えています。

あと細かいですが、新チームの名前を決めてしまいましょう。

肝はCSTの冠を乗っけることにあると思いますので、以下あたりが候補でしょうか。（この辺りはOMMCとの仕切り的にも割と重要かと）

決めの問題ですので増田さんにえいっと決めてもらえればと考えております。

ーCST- Surcharge unit or team

ーCST- Surcharge conversion unit or team

ーCST- Rate Strcuture covnersion unit or team

ーCST- Customer's Surcharge conversion unit

ーCST- Customer's Surcharge Condition conversion unit

寺田さん、

PPTの作成を頂きありがとうございます。おかげさまでだいぶ分かり易くなりました。

時短の為、クイックにフィードバック、お願い、及び1，2点質問させて頂けますでしょうか。

\*全体\*

テキストベースのDescriptionとFlowがセットになっているととても分かり易いと思いましたので、セットで作成頂くことは可能でしょうか。

Overall process flowの方は別途ツール側でもまとめて頂いているのですが、同じFlow

chart（左から右へ）のスタイルで作成頂く方が分かり易いです。

（現在のVerticalのものだとAll tradeのみのセッティングの場合はSVCに行かなくてよい、といったような終点が少々わかりにくいです）

逆にUpdate Process

flowもテキストベースで詳細になにをみてIssueを判断してどのファイルのどこになにを反映するのかというレベルで表現できるとありがたいです。

\*Overall Process Description\*

１．下記の”Eagle X”は具体的にだれのことでしょうか？実際Benとかがボタンを押すプロセスになっているのでしょうか？

２．どこかにテキストベースでのRate Structureテンプレの作成を埋めこみたいのですが、１か２に差し込んで頂けますでしょうか

必ずしも1を待たないと作成できないわけではないので、Sequentialに2に入れる必要はないかと思うのですが。

3． テンダーデータのコピーについて、具体的なコラムやどこからどこまで（全体であればもう少し具体的に）表現頂けましょうか。

\[image: image.png\]

\*Update Process\*

1．アクションの起点となる”Sale Reviewが終わった後のMail”的なものを最初に加えて頂けますでしょうか。

2．なんらかSurchargeのConditionがUpdateとなった場合、CST-CがSalesに再提出前にConversion

toolへのUpdateが必要かと思うのですが、理解正しいでしょうか。もしそうであればCST-Cの1軸を追加頂けますでしょうか。

ありがとうございます。

2枚目のスライドですが、先ほどのお話の通り、あくまでハイレベルに顧客の条件次第でプロセスが添付のような感じで整えて頂くことは可能でしょうか。

あくまで詳細は作って頂いたUser

GuideをReferさせるイメージでこちらのスライドはこれから何度か直面するであろう関係者への説明の際の概念的な説明用途に使う意図です（ちょうどUser

guideとOverallのテキストサマリーの中間くらいのイメージでしょうか）。

仲井さん、

スライドに加え、DANONのPricing tool（Surcharge 条件が取り込まれたもの）についてもお手すきにご共有頂けますと幸いです。

確かにこちらの方がわかりやすいです。ありがとうございます。

分岐に関しては、All Trade/Each

SVCどちらでも、i/iiと、iiiに分かれるので、あくまでAllとEachだけで分ければいいかもと考えておりましたが、

Each SVCにおいては、さらに詳細までやることはほぼないよね？というメッセージとしたいと理解しました。

添付でいかがでしょうか。若干シートが小さすぎるのですがあくまでイメージとして、原本も見ながら把握することを想定しております。

受信: Tue Aug 08 2023 14:54:33 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Koji Nakai \<koji.nakai@one-line.com\>  
Hi Rebecca,

As per our separate chat, please find LT MRG we received in Dec '22 or Jan

'23.

Appreciate that each trade haven't prepared LT MRG format for FY24 so if

they don't mind using the previous MRG we have for UAT, we can prepare the

pricing tool based on that.

Of course, in case Go-Live, we will update LT MRG to the latest one.

Awaiting you feedback.

返信が遅くなり、申し訳ございません。

ご確認くださり、ありがとうございました。

また、TenderSheetのご格納ありがとうございます。

＞OPUSにて詳細を確認し、Contract未受領のため、テンダーシートは未格納となっております。

こちらにつきましては、データをまだ受領していない契約となっているようです。

何卒よろしくお願いいたします。

続けて失礼いたします。

今後契約データを入手し、データ化させて頂きます。

なお、依頼においてはLATで追加となっている分も合わせて依頼しようと考えており、

LAT分を洗い出したうえで、別途フローランスさん、レアンドロさんにご連絡させていただくように致します。

お急ぎであれば、先に対象の「TOYO TIRE CORPORATION (TP): OSA0016B23, OSA0053B23、 (NON-TP):

下記理解ですので、理解違いないかご確認いただけると幸いです。

1\. Added Contract

3\. No OPUS Contract?

→念のためですが、Contractが空白となっています。Contractなしで問題ないか念のためご確認ください。

\*②現状不足しているContractの一覧化（J列「②Need to additional reciept Contract \#」）\*

Hi Masuda san,

Please, can I confirm if the CST has considered the last revised/missing

tender sheets (customer format) sent in my previous message for the

conversion study? (please, see here

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uS1rDp\_IrKRzemsqpnFHMEym6M6nk5B-RHrIed4sJ0g/edit\#gid=618304493\>

Per my check in the Status List file \- v45:

1\) I couldn't find the customers below added to the Status List yet:

2\) The Status flag/Confirmation Points in columns BD/BE haven't changed for

the customers below yet:

Last, please note that I have more three tender sheets (customer format) to

share with you for the conversion study.

These should be the last ones in order to cover all the LATAM BCO tenders

added to the GCSM calendar for the 2024 cycle.

Can I go ahead and add the folder link of these remaining tender sheets in

the same file (here

Good morning, Masuda san

Before sharing the tender sheets (customer formats) with you for the \*Offshore

\*accounts, should we wait for your confirmation that the conversion study

for all the LATAM onshore tenders has been concluded?

Checking in the Status List file v45 (test), we have the current status:

\*1)\* Tenders with conversion not completed yet and/or as blank status in

column BD:

\[image: image.png\]

\*2) \*Onshore tenders that haven't been added to the Status List v45 yet

(please, see here

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uS1rDp\_IrKRzemsqpnFHMEym6M6nk5B-RHrIed4sJ0g/edit\#gid=618304493\>

the

folder links with customer formats previously shared):

\[image: image.png\]

Last, please note that we were just invited for 2 new tenders that haven't

been quoted before in LATAM \- we are currently in the process of adding

them to the GCSM 2024 Tender Calendar.

   \- Mondelez WACAM (although the Company has quoted Mondelez before, this

   is a new one including the LATAM routes only) \- \*to be handled by

   Offshore\*

   \- Sumifru: \*to be handled as onshore\*

Please, kindly advise when should we share the customer formats for the

conversion study of the offshore tenders plus the new tenders just received.

Thanks.

Hi Cassandra,

So sorry for being late for the reply.

\*1)\* Tenders with conversion not completed yet and/or as blank status in

column BD:

\-\>We have completed the above 3 tender conversion studies.

    We will complete the remaining 3 tender conversion studies soon.

\[image: image.png\]

\*2) \*Onshore tenders that haven't been added to the Status List v45 yet

(please, see here

the

folder links with customer formats previously shared):

\-\>We are now cleaning up the accounts for FY24 season but anyway we will

upload those tenders to the status list and complete the conversion study

soon.

We also understood the Offshore/Onshore categories for Sumifru / Mondelez

WACAM.

Once you update those tenders in LATAM \- 2024 BCO Tender Calendar, please

let us know and provide those tender files as well.

We will update the status list and will conduct conversion studies.

Dears Irving and Natan,

good day

Please, note that for GHQ work on the conversion study of the LATAM BCO

tenders, we have provided all the customers' tender documents negotiated in

the latest season in the folder here

\<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W8cKIPSpoi5urN\_ZwIIAp0dmL4ftikWD\> \-

for \*onshore\* tenders only.

As for the next step, I kindly request your help to:

1\) Compare the current LATAM BCO Tender calendar vs the folder above to

make sure that it's not missing the tender documents for any other onshore

accounts. If missing any, please, kindly add to it.

2\) Share all the tender documents for the \*offshore\* accounts being handled

by the WNS team this time.  (I understand that GCSM Tender should share the

offshore ones being handled by OMMC).

I.e., for a/c BRF, Mabe, Mattel & Mondelez Wacam, if I'm not wrong.

Please, create new folders per account in the folder link above, and

confirm by return as soon as this is done. This way, GHQ/CST can start the

conversion study for this portion now.

Please, let me know if any questions. Thanks.

Best Regards,

Team,

Am trying to prepare Pricing Tool for Nova Era Silicon but it seems many

fields in \[ONE Format\] sheet are changing compared with the previous

version

and \[CustomerSheet\] is also being changed related with the version upgrade

so I have to manually update data.

So, I will make necessary amendments tonight, then will inform BR MKTG team

directly.

We have to carefully update Conversion tool/Consolidation tool considering

the linkage with Pricing Tool.

Let's discuss next week how/when to reflect ongoing enhancement items.

Best Regards

We double-checked Darrell's email before messaging you just to make sure

that we weren't the ones doing something wrong in this case but understood

now that the pricing tool isn't ready yet for this UAT.

We'll wait for your further instructions to act on this then.

Hi Ca \+ Flourance

Nova Era R1 submitted. Pls kindly check and confirm.

Follow some points:

\*Check list.\*

It shows the rate structure details as follow:

\[image: image.png\]

But the pricing tool did not bring these remarks in order to give us the

possibility to confirm if the surcharge structure is correct.

(In this case it was)

It brought a different remarks

\[image: image.png\]

\*DOC\*

It was mentioned in BRL even changing the currency for USD : Y

\[image: image.png\]

TSL

This surcharge is included and it is not appearing as the other ones

included and subject.

\[image: image.png\]

When we did a test defining the OFT by a target CM, only this OFT column

(OG) was fulfilled and the conversion did not work.

\[image: image.png\]

So we tried to define the OFT based on FRT Control panel, suggesting a

reduction based on current rate and the below column (FD) was fulfilled and

so the conversion worked.

\[image: image.png\]

Since there are many way / simulations to quote the OFT, can we understand

that the column above as Y/M should be always fulfilled ?

If the simulation do not fulfill it automatically, should we fulfill it

manually?

Because there is a formula on this collumn.

Tathi,

cc.: Gabriel

Thanks for the detailed feedback.

It's noted your concerns regarding the rate structure requirements reflect

the same in both the Checklist and the pricing tool.

From RHQ Sales/BPIT side we'll make sure to highlight to the account

managers to add the same details in both the Simplified format and

Conversion Checklist tabs at the time of filling up the file.

Hi Cassandra and Tathiana,

Please allow me to respond to the comments shared by Tathiana in

previous email.

\*1. Conversion Checklist \--\> Conversion Tool \--\> Pricing Tool\*

There are two worksheets in the Simplified Format which Account Managers

would have to complete to start Conversion Process by CST.

\<\*①Simplified Format\*\> worksheet: This worksheet is regarded as a "Customer

Sheet" in the Conversion Tool; whatever input in this worksheet would be

directly converted and passed to Pricing Tool \<Pricing Sheet\>.

\<\*②Conversion Checklist\*\> worksheet: The checklist acts as a quick

reference for CST to correctly update Field Mappings. In case of

different expression of rate structure from \<\*①Simplified Format\*\>

worksheet, this would not appear in the "Customer Sheet" however as a

Remark in Field Mappings / Customer Sheet. Therefore this is passed to

Pricing Tool as a Remark in cells BO5 / BP5 / BQ5 (as per screenshot).

From pricing perspective, we recognised that these Remarks are also

crucial in pricing considerations. We will review how to show these in

Pricing Tool \<Pricing Sheet\>.

\[image: image.png\]

\[image: image.png\]

\*2. DOC / Local Surcharges\*

Although it is flagged as \*Y\* \= Export (USD), the surcharge quantum would

still be shown in local currency level in \<Pricing Sheet\>.

However, from the backend logic / background update, it would have been

converted to USD currency level and, for example, (1) included into All-In

rate calculation, or (2) exported to \<Customer Sheet\> in USD currency level.

\*3. TSL / Uncommon Local Surcharges\*

Please let us share in the upcoming catch up call on the new functionality

on rate structure part which Pricer could retrieve uncommon local

surcharges.

\*4. Base Rate / Benchmark by Target CM/TEU\*

After input Target CM/20' in column OL, which the Required FRT 20' in

column OG would be automatically updated (due to formula in columns OG-OI).

Then Pricers would have to click \[FRT Control Panel\] \> \[Benchmark\] \>

\[Adjustment Type\] \> \[Run\], then Base Rate 20' in column FD would be

calculated and updated.

\[image: image.png\]

Yes, Pricers should always fulfill / input when Row 1 showing "Y/M" which

are mandatory fields required in Customer Sheet.

In case of blank cells (such as above Base Rate 20' calculation), please

try to retrieve from \[Get Data\] or \[FRT Control Panel\] so that these

(formula) can be calculated and updated accordingly. Current Macro

functions suffice to cover the same operation.

\[image: image.png\]

I hope I have addressed your concerns. In case of any missing points,

please let us further clarify in the upcoming catch up call.

Best Regards,

\*Flourance Tan\*

Hello Flourance, good day\!

Note below our comments:

\*1. Conversion Checklist \--\> Conversion Tool \--\> Pricing Tool\*

Understood your point, but could you please confirm about the comment in

the Pricing Tool, column BE? Where did this comment came from, since is

incorrect and not matching the one provided by Sales in the Checklist?

\[image: image.png\]

\*2. DOC / Local Surcharges\*

Noted, but in regards of DOC, this is never charged in BRL \- even tohugh is

an origin charge. The currency of it must always be USD, as per the tariff.

How it will be corrected so Brazil lanes always show it accordingly?

\*3. TSL / Uncommon Local Surcharges\*

Noted, we'll wait for the meeting.

\*4. Base Rate / Benchmark by Target CM/TEU\*

Noted on how to fill in the rate when we have specified the CM/Target.

But how does it work when we define the rates in column NW/NX/NY? We've

tried the 'FORMULA' & 'OFFER RATE' options, but it did not work.

We'll be waiting for the meeting to be scheduled to further discuss points

1 & 2\.

Thank you\!

Hi Tatiane,

Although we had discussed during Monday's call, please allow me to recap

and reply below email.

\*1. Conversion Checklist \--\> Conversion Tool \--\> Pricing Tool\*

This is from the Simplified Format

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12OV93xKJnF0IAjNEl6mU\_4P\_kXKKDvtm1nD41nTJWOc/edit\#gid=675922366\>

input by Sales, please refer to column BB.

As shared, \<\*①Simplified Format\*\> worksheet is regarded as a "Customer

Sheet" in the Conversion Tool. Therefore the same information is imported

to Pricing Tool.

\*2. DOC / Local Surcharges\*

For Local Surcharges in Pricing Sheet, the surcharge quantum remains at

local currency level despite it being flagged as \*Y\* \= Export (USD).

However we understood MKTG team would like to pass the information from

Pricing Sheet to Customer Sheet as well as to draw Sales' attention to the

rate offer \+ rate structure \+ surcharge quantum etc. Please let us consider

how to pass this rate structure information (as shown in screenshot

example).

\[image: image.png\]

\*3. TSL / Uncommon Local Surcharges\*

Believe the enhanced Pricing Tool has addressed the concern of retrieving

uncommon local surcharges.

\*4. Base Rate / Benchmark by All-In Rate\*

As shared in the call, please

   1\. input the intended All-In Rate Offer in columns EI-EK,

   2\. select \[Calculation Reference Base\] \= "All In" (column EM),

   3\. remove surcharges in \[Offer Rate \- Subject\] (column EN),

   4\. click \[Surcharge Update\] button to ensure no surcharge exists

   for \[Offer Rate \- Subject\] (column EN),

   5\. click \[All In Rate Calculation\] then the intended All-In Rate will be

   refreshed in columns EQ-ES.

\[image: image.png\]

Meanwhile please view the enhanced pricing tool from this folder for your

UAT purpose.

Thank you again for your clarifications regarding our previous questions.

Regarding the new test, we were able to use all the tools and everything

seems to be working correctly.

1- Only note that THL value is incorrect, tariff now is BRL 985:

\[image: image.png\]

2 \- I'm not sure why when I try to use the 'GET DATA' function in the

network, it appears below error, but note Tathiana has been able to use it

accordingly.

3- File has been submitted accordingly:

Tati,

Thank you so much for your quick action on this.

@Flourance Tan \<flourance.tan@one-line.com\> : appreciate it if you can

check and answer the points raised by Tati, especially in regards to the

THL currency mentioned in the pricing tool, so that we can move forward

with this UAT and receive the consolidated rate offer file from CST.

Obs.: When it comes to the customer's requirements for the surcharges

currency though, please note that Nova Era requests them to be quoted as

fixed quantum in local currency. So, THL is one of the surcharges that

should be informed in BRL currency at the time of submitting our rate offer

to the customer.

Thank you for your feedback,

1\. THL value: Apologies, the base data on Surcharge has not yet been

refreshed with the latest Surcharge Quantum wef 01 Apr 2023\. We will take

note and update the same.

2\. Guess this is due to the folder access right issue. Please let us

Thank you Ben.

Hi Cassandra, Tathiane,

Please allow me to update on point 2 raised in previous email.

We investigated and learnt that this is NOT an access right issue. Pricers

can access this folder without any issue, therefore we suspect this error

message might be caused by unstable network when Tathiane performed \[GET

DATA\] function.

I would suggest both LE MKTG (or LA MKTG) and GHQ to monitor and test again

with different Pricing Tools among different Pricers. In case of

recurrence, we will have to address this error to avoid impact to live

tender pricing operations.

Best Regards,

\*Morning Masuda san / Flourance,\*

Please allow me to share some background for this E2E Test.

During Consolidation of this Tender, unfortunately we encountered some

error which we immediately highlighted to PWC.  But it seems we need to do

a lot of adjustments for both the Pricing Tool and the Consolidation Tool

and might take time to resolve this issue.   Considering that this tender

only involves 2 lanes, with alignment  with Flourance, we have proceeded to

reconversion, copy and paste Pricer's offer to the original Customer file

and submit it back to Sales.  Kindly note that the Pricing Tool and

Conversion tool used in this tender is believed to be the previous version,

so I think we don't need to further update those versions.

Also, let me share the background situation of below comments from cst.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CST Comments:

1). Please evaluate the counter-offer given by the Pricer in columns BG,

BI, and BJ regarding the Free Time.

Customer Request: \<DTOC \= 15 days\> \<DMIF \= 14 days\> \<DTIC \= 13 days\>

Pricer Counter-offer: \<DTOC \= 14 days\> \<DMIF \= 6 days\> \<DTIC \= 7 days\>

Ben:  Based on our checking, Pricers have overwritten the Requested

Freetime for this tender.  So we captured Pricer's counter Offer instead.

2). Please take note of the changes in column BB \-

From \-- "All charges involved must be quoted as fixed with the quantum

specified, with no exception (Bunker, Seal, Security Fee, ISPS, destination

THC, and others). These charges and BL Fee must not be adjusted during the

contractual term."

To \-- "Rates are subject to OBS as per ONE tariff \+ all other surcharges at

origin and destination as per ONE tariff (including TSL \+ CSS \+ HAZ \+ AMS \+

THD). ONE Bunker Surcharge (OBS) will be reviewed on a quarterly basis."

Ben: This portion is actually tagged as Customer's Remarks during

conversion, but during Pricer's Submission wordings were changed /

updated.  So in order to relay Pricer's Intention, we Captured the Updated

wordings from Pricer's submission instead.

3). Kindly refer to the additional columns in BN, BO, and BP which contain

the customer requested TT details.

Ben: This is a additional request from Sales in the Checklist \- to indicate

Transit Details, but there is no assigned column in the  Simplified

Format.  So during ReConversion we have added corresponding columns for

these requirements to meet Sales requests.

         Also note that during Pricers Submission, tagging for this

additional request was removed and not visible anymore in the

Consolidation  (not really sure if the Pricing tool was updated), so TT

Details was not auto-generated.  Hence we input TT details Manually based

on the Route Summary provided by Pricer.

Let me know if any concerns.

Thank you.

Hi Ben,

Thank you for the feedback and also the extra attention given during

consolidation process.

1\. At this moment, Remarks input in Conversion Tool's \[Field Mapping\]

(column S) is captured in Pricing Tool's Customer Sheet instead of Pricing

Sheet. Suspect this is the reason why Pricer overlooked this Free Time

Requirement by Customer. Let us consider how to reflect this Remarks in

Pricing Sheet.

\[image: image.png\]

2\. Noted. This is due to misalignment of Rate Structure in Simplified

Format and Conversion Checklist input by Sales, and Pricers took the latter

as Primary Requirement.

This had been shared with LA Tender team earlier and they will remind Sales

to input same Rate Structure in both Simplified Format and Conversion

Checklist to avoid confusion.

3\. Noted, thank you for the additional work by CST / EagleX Support team.

Best Regards,

Thank you, Nikko.

Hi @Flourance Tan \<flourance.tan@one-line.com\> , @Kazuki Masuda

\<kazuki.masuda@one-line.com\>

Please, kindly see our comments after the consolidated rate offer file has

been received for this Simplified process UAT of Nova Era Silicon:

   \- CST added to the email: \*"The Consolidated Rate file and the Updated

   Original Customer file have been uploaded in the link here:"\*

However, in the case of a Simplified process, there is \*no\* original

customer file. Thus, this can be confusing for Sales.

Please, may I suggest changing this format to: "\*The Consolidated Rate file

has been uploaded in the link here:"\*

Although there is also the Simplified format added to the same folder, for

safety's sake and also to avoid duplicated information, we suggest that

Sales is instructed to focus and work with only 1 file.

   \- And after checking both files added to the "Back to Sales" folder, it

   seems easier/simpler to use the Consolidated rate file for Sales to

   verify/copy the rates offer and send them to the customer.

For that though, we would like to request if it's possible to add the 3

columns below to the Consolidate rate file instead of the Simplified format

(as it is currently).

This way, Sales would have all the info needed in one source to copy the

rates offer and send them to the customer.

\[image: image.png\]

   \- Last, in regards to the statement below added to the CST email, this

   seems to fit only in the case of normal processes.

\*"Reminding that only the Updated Original Customer file is allowed to be

sent to Customer. Please do NOT submit the internal consolidated rate file

as it contains confidential information."\*

May I recommend changing the statement as per the proposal below? This

would be applied to the Simplified processes:

\*"Please do NOT submit the internal consolidated rate file to the customer

as it contains confidential information. You should use this file just to

get the rate offer provided by the pricer, and then format it into

externally facing information."\*

We can further discuss these points in our call next Monday. Thanks.

Hi Cassandra,

Thank you for your feedback.

We discussed internally and would like to reconfirm with LA RHQ that, in

case of Simplified Format, CST would only need to share the consolidated

rate file without Simplified Format.

If affirmative, then we are good to proceed as follow,

   \- CST added to the email: \*"The Consolidated Rate file and the Updated

   Original Customer file have been uploaded in the link here:"\*

However, in the case of a Simplified process, there is \*no\* original

consolidated rate file.

   seems easier/simpler to use the Consolidated rate file for Sales to

   verify/copy the rates offer and send them to the customer.

Hi Flourance,

Thank you for your quick return on this.

As per discussed in our call this morning, in the case of the Simplified

format, we confirm that CST can share only the Consolidated rate file (i.e.

no Simplified format to be returned to Sales) as long as the

TT-related information is updated in the Consolidated rate file, which you

already confirmed that it's possible to do.

My comments are highlighted in \*black\* as follows:

   \- CST added to the email: \*"The Consolidated Rate file and the Updated

   Original Customer file have been uploaded in the link here:"\*

However, in the case of a Simplified process, there is \*no\* original

Sales is instructed to focus and work with only 1 file.

EagleX: Agreed on the same where CST would only update and share the

consolidated rate file.

\*CP: Great\! Thanks and we should consider this update to share with Sales

during the training sessions.\*

   \- And after checking both files added to the "Back to Sales" folder, it

   seems easier/simpler to use the Consolidated rate file for Sales to

   verify/copy the rates offer and send them to the customer.

\*CP: Great\! Will advise Sales acc.\*

   \- Last, in regards to the statement below added to the CST email, this

   seems to fit only in the case of normal processes.

\*"Reminding that only the Updated Original Customer file is allowed to be

May I recommend changing the statement as per the proposal below? This

would be applied to the Simplified processes:

\*"Please do NOT submit the internal consolidated rate file to the customer

as it contains confidential information. You should use this file just to

get the rate offer provided by the pricer, and then format it into

externally facing information."\*

EagleX: Noted, we will advise CST to update the same.

\*CP: Great, thanks\! This updated comment should be more clear for Sales

understanding when it comes to Simplified formats.\*

\*Last, there are 2 remaining items that I would like to check with you:\*

   \- \*Regarding the Marketing remarks/counter-proposal on the rate

   structure for this UAT:\*

CST updated the Marketing remarks in the "Surcharge Customer Request"

field. But this can be confusing for Sales since the Marketing proposal

might not necessarily reflect what has been originally requested by the

Customer.

\[image: image.png\]

\*What about if the pricer remarks/counter-proposal were added to the

"Internal Remark" \- column D, or \*\*to the "Remark" \- column BT (right after

the "Offer rate" columns) instead?\*

\[image: image.png\]

\[image: image.png\]

   \- \*Offer Rate Currency and Surcharge Columns: \*

\*a) Offer Rate Currency:\* We noticed that column BS came as blank in the

Consolidated Rate file. For safety's sake, we would recommend that this is

updated as USD Currency by CST as this is linked to the ocean freights

offered (columns BO \- BR).

\*b) Surcharge columns ("Subject", "Fixed", Include")\*\*:\* Nova Era Silicon

requests all the applicable surcharges to be offered as fixed during the

entire tender period.

In this sense, the customer expects to receive the surcharge quantum for

all the applicable surcharges at the time our proposal is sent.

In a scenario of fixed surcharges accepted by the pricers, shouldn't the

surcharge codes and their quantum be specified in the Consolidated Rate

file as well?

In fact, we were expecting that all the surcharges related to the port

pairs quoted (as subject/fixed/include) would be duly mentioned in columns

BX \- BZ of the Consolidated Rate file according to the pricers' proposal

for all the quotations done through Eagle-X process.

Please, can EagleX team comment on that too? Thanks again.

Hi Cassandra,

Please view our comments in blue,

   \- \*Regarding the Marketing remarks/counter-proposal on the rate

   structure for this UAT:\*

CST updated the Marketing remarks in the "Surcharge Customer Request"

field. But this can be confusing for Sales since the Marketing proposal

might not necessarily reflect what has been originally requested by the

Customer.

\[image: image.png\]

EagleX: The confusion came from different rate structures in Simplified

Format and Conversion Checklist as discussed earlier in mid Jun.

LE MKTG expected and regarded the rate structure in Conversion Checklist as

the correct rate structure, therefore EagleX / CST considered the same

and overwrote in consolidated rate file.

\*What about if the pricer remarks/counter-proposal were added to the

"Internal Remark" \- column D, or \*\*to the "Remark" \- column BT (right after

the "Offer rate" columns) instead?\*

\[image: image.png\]

\[image: image.png\]

EagleX: As a general guideline, any rate structure counter offered by

Pricers should be input as \*Internal Remark\* by Pricers in the Pricing

Tool. Pricers should not input / overwrite Customer's requirements which

are in grey-coloured columns in Pricing Tool.

CST simply consolidates all Pricer Submission files. Whilst CST will

counter check if the consolidated rate file / updated customer file has any

discrepancy to the \*original\* customer file,

\- For Pricer Input columns in customer file, CST will overwrite with Pricer

offers,

\- For non-Pricer Input columns (e.g. Customer's requirements columns), CST

will not overwrite but highlight in email content on changes made by

Pricers when returning consolidated rate file and updated customer file.

   \- \*Offer Rate Currency and Surcharge Columns: \*

\*a) Offer Rate Currency:\* We noticed that column BS came as blank in the

Consolidated Rate file. For safety's sake, we would recommend that this is

updated as USD Currency by CST as this is linked to the ocean freights

offered (columns BO \- BR).

EagleX: This was due to missing Field Mapping in Conversion Tool, hence

this required information was not passed to Pricing Tool. We will follow up.

\*b) Surcharge columns ("Subject", "Fixed", Include")\*\*:\* Nova Era Silicon

requests all the applicable surcharges to be offered as fixed during the

entire tender period.

In this sense, the customer expects to receive the surcharge quantum for

all the applicable surcharges at the time our proposal is sent.

In a scenario of fixed surcharges accepted by the pricers, shouldn't the

surcharge codes and their quantum be specified in the Consolidated Rate

file as well?

In fact, we were expecting that all the surcharges related to the port

pairs quoted (as subject/fixed/include) would be duly mentioned in columns

BX \- BZ of the Consolidated Rate file according to the pricers' proposal

for all the quotations done through Eagle-X process.

Please, can EagleX team comment on that too? Thanks again.

\[image: image.png\]

EagleX: Noted, we found the same comment in Conversion Checklist (old

version though). This would be passed as Remarks to Pricing Tool and

Pricers would have to identify and input the required Surcharge Name / Code

and Quantum.

\[image: image.png\]

In Conversion Checklist (new version), if Sales could identify the required

fixed surcharge and check the box (blue boxed), it would be highly

appreciated.

Otherwise, Sales will have to check "Others" / "Not listed on Customer

Sheet" (red boxed) then indicate the requirement.

\[image: image.png\]

As a workaround, CST will create additional column(s) for this Surcharge

requirement as mandatory input by Pricers.

In Pricing Tool, Pricers to

1\. Identify Rate Structure Reference Basis (column EN) \- Customer's

Request, Current Contract, LT MRG, Subject All, or All In basis.

\[image: image.png\]

2\. In case of any Fixed Surcharge required by Customer and agreed by

Pricers, input Surcharge Code in Offer Rate \- Fixed (column EP).

    \*\* EagleX team will update script for \[Surcharge Update\] in order to

Hi Otsuka-san and Masuda-san,

Apologies for the delayed response and thank you for your patience.

Kindly find the pending items below:

   1\. Ads \- Image, Text and Keywords for review

   \<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13dbccHuFSHCGChIGzXMOckh84DrdgL\_aa1Cp2Jo9Wjs/edit?usp=sharing\>

   2\. Landing Page Draft for review

      \- Image and Content for Pop up screen (Form) \- Found when clicked

      onto "Write to us"

   3\. New expanding target accounts list for screening (attached) \-

   currently the Taiwan list might be insufficient as there's either a lack of

   such companies in Zoominfo in TW and/or most of the companies present in

   Zoominfo has been covered by your customer list. Let me see what I can do

   to add on to the numbers.

   4\. Process Flow Slide

Hi Otsuka-san,

Kindly view the list of Zoominfo attributes that can be used for the study

here

\<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SxfS\_xVgHNZeQitCUDngugkGVbFGdQ8YBKjA7oyk3u0/edit?usp=sharing\>

.

For the Job Functions, I have expanded some of them for your reference \-

mostly those that might be more relevant. Feel free to let me know if you

have any questions or concerns.

I've also attached the invoice for the first half of the project as noted

in the SOW. Do let me know what I should include for the reference number

based on your internal policy (if any).

Many thanks,

Hi Otsuka-san,

Hope you've had a great weekend.

Based on the action items, may I check when is the expected date for DP to

receive the Customer List?

Also, for tomorrow's meeting \- will the team prefer to meet physically? I

understand that it was preferable for the previous meeting, except that

some of my team had back-to-back calls so we were unable to do so. Do let

us know your team's preference.

Apart from last week's outstanding discussions, here's two other things

that we would like to discuss for tomorrow to help us with the campaign

preparations:

   \- Desired Positioning for ONE QUOTE (if any by the Comms team)

   \- Project timeline

Many thanks,

Dear Cheryl,

So sorry for belated reply.

Let me answer for your questions 1 by 1 in blue.

\*Zoominfo         \-\*Thanks for the attribute but we feel that it is

difficult to make a condition from scratch, so suggest uploading and

analyze from our customer list to have proper attributes.

\*Customer list\*  \- plan to provide tomorrow as 1st snapshot. Let us share

how you should read the list during the meeting.

\*Meeting style \* \- As discussed separately, let's conduct virtually for

this week.

\*Invoice            \- \*Let us further understand better for tomorrow's

meeting about some points such as..

                           1.how we understand "Hypo" assumption portion

cost (e.g we do not khow much customer info we purchased from Zoominfo)

                           2\. the reason why we will pay this cost is that

you need to use that cost to execute ?

                               I do not know the market standard approach

in Digital Marketing area but we usually have invoice settlement after the

service/output is there

                               Please do not get us wrong, we are not

hesitating but trying to understand since it is new to us.

\*Agenda            \*- Including yours, I want to cover the topics as

followings.

## Eagle-X LATAM: Missing tender sheets

受信: Thu Jun 01 2023 07:57:46 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Cassandra Peretto \<cassandra.peretto@one-line.com\>  
Hi Masuda san,

Please, refer to the attached file and kindly consider the comments below:

1\. In column AF you'll see the link to the G-drive folders where the

missing tender sheets were added;

2\. There are some duplicated accounts in this list as well as some others

that aren't tenders. Please, remember to filter column AC as the first

action in order to select only the following options:

a) "ok";

b) "Added \- new".

3\. Please, also note that:

a) Customer "Gestion Cargo Zona Franca" is the shipper of "Grupo Nutresa"

tender. So, Grupo Nutresa tender sheet is the one to be considered;

b) Customers "St. Andrews Smoky Delicacies" and "Sudmaris Chile Sociedad

Anonima" are shippers of "Agricola Ariztia" tender. So, the tender sheet of

Agricola Ariztia is the one to be considered.

c) Customers "SCM Minera Lumina Copper Chile" and "Toyota del Ecuador" fall

under the Simplified process \= no tender sheets are received from them for

quotation.

4\. Please, see in column P the "Handling Office" (as Onshore/Offshore)

updated for the LA accounts (based on the 2023 tender calendar).

Per talked, we should revise it again after the 2024 tender calendar is

closed (it should be around August).

Let me know if any questions and/or if any other tender sheets are missing.

Thanks.

under the Simplified process \= no tender sheets are received from them for

quotation.

4\. Please, see in column P the "Handling Office" (as Onshore/Offshore)

updated for the LA accounts (based on the 2023 tender calendar).

Per talked, we should revise it again after the 2024 tender calendar is

closed (it should be around August).

Let me know if any questions and/or if any other tender sheets are missing.

Thanks.

\*増田さん、\*

突然メールを展開して申し訳ございません。

上述のメッセージ及び、添付の資料をご参照願います。

色々と説明は受けたものの、具体的な取り組みについては、未だVagueではありますが、何れにせよBPITがDriveする全体的なChange

ManagementのStructureと連携して、個別のProjectのChange

Managementを図りたいという意図は汲み取れるので、どの程度の得られるメリットが出てくるのかは定かでないですが、Yield Management

DX Master Planに関連するProjectについては、Eagle X

Supportで活躍してくれているメンバーを中心に、我々独自のChange Management

Teamを設計、構築しつつ、全体との連携という意味で、こちらのスキームと関わっていくのが効率的かと思いました。

説明を聞いている感じだと、High

Levelな活動が中心で、TrainingやSurvey等の具体的な支援はありそうですが、日々の滑った転んだについては、各プロジェクトで適宜やるような相関関係になるかと思います。

何れにしましても、この機会にEagle X

Supportのみでなく、SYM/DYMが管掌するProject全体をサポートする仕掛けづくりと、キチンとしたRole＆Responsibilityを設計するにはよい機会かと思います。その上で、BPIT主体のこの取り組みに参画する要員を1名アポイントしたいと思いますが、如何でしょうか？

Hi Peiyee, Jacob, Josef, Otsuka san and Michida san,

Hope all is well with everyone.

I hope all of you had a decent understanding of the change management

preposition presentation. As part of maintaining momentum, may I request to

receive your nominations no later than Friday 16 June. I believe this

timeline should be sufficient for your planning and decision needs. Another

suggestion for consideration would be to add one more nominee to your list.

Reason is to maintain support continuity in scenarios of employee turnover

or any other valid cause. It's wise for us to be proactive and be prepared

for uncertainties.

Meanwhile, feel free to reach me should you have any questions or concerns

to the above-said. Thank you all in advance.

ご連絡いただきありがとうございます。

はい、ぜひ全体でAllignさせて頂きつつ、我々にないノウハウ等があれば吸収して個別PJに展開できればと思います。

こちらの連携担当としてYueshengに参画してもらいたいと考えており、本人にも伝えております。

＞SYM/DYMが管掌するProject全体をサポートする仕掛けづくりと、キチンとしたRole＆

こちらについても承知いたしました。BPITの話も聞きつつ、DYMのCMとして横断してサポートする部分と個別PJで担う必要がある部分などしっかりR\&Rを設計していければと思いますので、別途ご相談させていただければ幸いです。

よろしくお願い致します。

増田さん、

早速のご対応及び担当者の推薦有難うございます。大変助かります。

正直、BPIT側のInitiativeは、TrainingやSurvey

Schemeの導入以外は然程期待しておりませんが、肝心なのは我々のプロジェクトを支援するための仕掛け（Change Management

Team）を、自前で作り上げつつ、統一感を持った（Visionや、手法、或いはVideo

Clipの構成等も含めて）アプローチを展開することが肝要かと思いますので、是非この機会にお願い申し上げます。

別電の、HKG Teamをお呼びする機会に、是非このTeam（でもTask

Forceでも構いませんが、先ずは形から）を正式に立ち上げる様な段取りで如何でしょうか？皆さんをMotivateするにも大事な事かと思っております。

ありがとうございます。

現在のCMチームはDYMのPJ全体のCMを支援し始めていますが、成果物をどこまで共通化して、どこを差異化するかや、どこまでCMとして踏み込んで個別PJを支援するか等明確にしないといけないと感じておりましたので、この機会にTeamとして立ち上げつつ、各種ルールやアプローチ方法を明確化して、DYMのPJを支援できるようにいたします。

私の方でただきを準備して参りますので、また1on1でコメントいただけますと幸いです。

よろしくお願い致します。
