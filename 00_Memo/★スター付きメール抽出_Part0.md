## New NOR biz opportunity from DLC. / Expeditor Chile.

受信: Fri Jul 11 2025 05:34:59 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Belen Cruz \<belen.cruz@one-line.com\>  
Hi Adele, how are you?

I’m reaching out regarding a potential shipment opportunity of Expeditor

Chile of \*11x40' NOR units\*, ready to move from CNDLC \- CLSAI this July.

The client is requesting a \*rate adjustment to USD 1,400 all-in\* in order

to proceed.

We understand that rate flexibility is often limited; however, we believe

this request deserves strong consideration for the following reasons:

   1\.

   The units are \*NOR containers\*, which provide equipment repositioning

   value to the network.

   2\.

   \*The client has been asked to increase their import volumes\*, and this

   is a chance to secure additional business.

   3\.

   The \*FAK rates shared today were perceived as uncompetitive\*. For

   context, \*MSC is currently offering USD 1,600 all-in NOR\*, which we’ve

   already documented in the market intel drive.

Additionally, we had a meeting with the customer just yesterday, where we

discussed the opportunity to \*rebuild trust and resume import bookings with

ONE\*. It’s important to highlight that they’ve had \*negative experiences

with our service in the past\*, and this is a sensitive but important step

in recovering the relationship.

We presented this as a joint effort aligned with the \*current campaign in

Chile to increase import volumes from China\*—making this an important

window for reconnection and growth.

We would really appreciate your support in reviewing this case and seeing

if we can align on the rate.

Please let us know if you need any further details.

Saludos/ Best regards,

Dear Adele,

I'm asking your support to push in order to confirm\* booking DL4CB1767900. \*

Customer requesting several times for the release to DLC office

without success.

As you can understand, getting the booking confirmations is extremely

important — \*first, because these are NOR containers, which are extremely

needed here in Chile\*, and second, because we’re working to regain the

trust of this customer for their import shipments with ONE. Any delays in

the confirmation process don’t put us in a good position with them.

I’d really appreciate your support with the Dalian office on this.

Hi Belen,

We understand CL needs NOR but pls understand it is subject to \*space\* and

\*draft\* conditions

I have checked booking, but this is showing D5 units instead? I have also

checked there is no AP for this account. I also said to take 3 units but

this booking is 10 units?

Also just to share we are facing tight space situation with around

1500TEU of roll pool (considering the Posorja Express issue as well) hence

it is difficult now since this is a big lot

Dear Adele, most of our competitors, especially the larger ones, are

applying competitive rates for NOR to meet demand for the upcoming cherry

season, so we must keep an eye on the market.

Maersk has already contacted Cleaner with USD 1,000/NOR \+ THC (D), as Paula

reported separately.

Thank you for your consideration and your usual support.

HI Julio,

Our space is really full now and roll pool has increased to around 1800TEU.

On top of that we have heavy draft issues as well.

Probably more information can be relayed during CGM, but POLs have issues

to accommodate additional bookings hence there is no merit to drop so low.

Also have to take into account this request is only subject to THD/CSS,

hence I will maintain our current offer

Dear Adele,

We truly understand the space situation — we really do. However, it's

extremely difficult to grow our import volumes if the terms change after

the bookings have already been confirmed.

These bookings have been pursued by the customer since July. Due to lack of

space and delayed confirmations, the only available option was the August

vessel. Now, increasing the rates after the bookings have finally been

confirmed — especially after considerable effort to get them released —

makes us appear unreliable and untrustworthy. Understandably, no client

would want to continue working with us under such changing conditions.

We appreciate your support on this matter and kindly ask if we could

maintain the same rates at least until August 15th.

 Saludos/ Best regards,

Dear Adele, strictly speaking, we're only considering one perspective, not

taking into account the need to increase Nor's shipments to cope with the

upcoming cherry season.

This isn't an isolated case, as we're also separately requesting a rate

adjustment for IMP. CLEANER, a regular Nor customer, which we're losing to

Maersk due to their extremely

competitive rate compared to ours.

Please see our suggestion for both cases  in blue letters.

\*CASE 1\) EXPEDITORS\*

CNDLC \- CLSAI USD2400/40NOR

\*All in subject to THD/CSS only\*

Local charges not manifested by ONE, customers are to pay to the local

offices accordingly.

\--\>\*In this case cargo was booked in July and it was rolled over to August

by us , consequently it seems reasonable to extend the rate until the

middle of august( USD 1,650 \++).\*

\*Customer commitment to load 10 teus ( 5x40' nor) the first half of August.\*

\*CASE 2\) IND.CLEANER\*

local charges (short)

Local charges not manifested by ONE, customers are to pay to the local

offices accordingly.

CY/CY, Non-DG

Rates are subject to equipment and space availability

If there is no nomination within 7 days, our rates will be null and void

immediately

Valid: 1/8/25 \- 31/8/25

\--\> \*To keep shipments with ONE (2-3 NOR/wk ), Cleaner needs a new rate

adjustment, considering the low value of its  cargo. The positive issue is

that the  t/t fm  CNTAO is the  shortest one, therefore no need to match

 Maersk level\*

\* but offer  USD1900 \+ DTH \+ CSS for  August.\*

Last but not least , the NOR levels reported by our colleagues fluctuate

between usd 2,100-2,200 ( FAK sheet ) instead usd 2,800/nor ,  but if we do

round voyage exercise, the cargo contribution Impo NOR+ REE export   is

much better than

Impo Dry \+ Expo dry .

Thanks for your consideration.

Best regards

Please review both cases, as we have a clear mandate to secure regular

business with Nor.

Thanks in advance \+ best regards.

Hi Julio,

I have replied to each separately.

As per your message below, if rates are fluctuating between USD2100-2200

(adding rate input from CL below) then why are the requests so much lower

than this rate level?

Understand it is on spot basis but it is a huge gap between moving rate

levels

Dear Adele,

We truly appreciate your effort on this.

For future NOR business opportunities, it would really help if we could

stay aligned with GHQ guidance. That way, negotiations can flow more

easily, with fewer restrictions, making the offer more appealing to the

customer — and helping us grow this type of equipment in Chile as we’re

aiming to.

Hi Belen,

Sending the appropriate equipment to the correct destination is indeed the

proper intention, but it has to be subject to reasonable rate levels (not a

huge gap between current moving rate levels which are workable)

Hi Adele, Michelle and Jason are reporting USD 1700/1800 per NOR for

August, which is in line with our previous requests to adjust NOR levels

due to anticipated reefer demand, so we highly

recommend you to follow the market for this type of eq.

Dear Adele and Kazuki (Welcome\!\!\!)

Expeditor has informed us that they once again have a batch of NOR units

(9xNOR) ready to ship on August 14\. However, the rate we previously offered

— \*USD 2,400\* — is significantly above current market levels.

As noted by several colleagues in the GDrive updates, rates for similar NOR

shipments are currently averaging around \*USD 1,700\*.

\[image: image.png\]

Additionally, this was one of the key topics highlighted during the recent

CGM meeting, where the need for NOR availability in Chile — especially in

preparation for cherry season — was clearly emphasized.

Also considering this is a regular business opportunity of approximately

10xNOR every two weeks, we would like to ask if it’s possible to extend the

first rates offered, so we can secure this volume.

\<kyra.mao@one-line.com\>,

Appreciate your help to confirm booking \*DL4CB1831800\*.

Customer took booking in a bigger vessel (ONE SPIRIT). It is very important

to us this volume, because it is a regular biz with shipment each

two weeks, so we can not delay the releasing.

Dear @Soon Ang Chong \<soonang.chong@one-line.com\>

Considering this biz has this volume each two weeks, is it possible to have

this rate until the end of August? In that way, we provide the client more

confidence and consistency, which helps us maintain a steady business.

Also our idea is to add this NOR biz in the September AP, but we depend on

rates level and validity.

Thanks Roberto for the option.

The problem could be the validity rates, because the current rates are

until the end of August and vessel has an application date in September and

I don't know if customer will accept to load two weeks later, considering

they are filed in September APwith more cargo. Is no chance to load in the

original vessel than the customer requested?

I saw the standby detail and it doesn't seem like over vessel utilization.

Dear Belen

Please noted target Vessel BSA is small and only 89Teu/1157 Ton

Now Firm AP booking already 91 Teu/1341 Ton which over BSA

And you booking is 16 Teu which mean 20% BSA for DLC which will bring huge

roll for AX2 Next voyage

AX2 is just suffer huge roll during Aug first half

We not expected rebuild huge roll again which will imapct all customer

So please change to SBFT2534E to keep a healthy roll

Dear Kazuki,

Appreciate your help to quote again this biz, but we really need an extend

return to you every 2 weeks or sometimes a week.

So it would be really helpful a more validity for this regular biz.

Here is the target:

CNDLC \- CLSAI , CLCNL \*USD1100\*/40NOR

\*All in subject to THD/CSS only\*

Local charges not manifested by ONE, customers are to pay to the local

offices accordingly.

CY/CY, Non- DG

\*Validity: A month minimum\*

@Simon Wong \<simon.wong@one-line.com\> appreciate your support in this

matter.
