# Power BI report internal discussion

Last discussion

- Power BI is no longer permitted company-wide and must be replaced with one of the following:
    - **Looker** (Managed by DDE) → The data you want to output must be available in Looker Explore.
    - **Looker Studio** → Allows for ad hoc data additions

- Migrating the **Supply Demand** component:
    - eeSea data, including Supply information, is already available in Looker
    - If everything can be covered with eeSea data, select the desired charts currently used by AFLA and:
        - Check if the requirements can be met using Dejima’s dashboard; if not, submit additional requirements for implementation
    - If eeSea data alone is insufficient and manual supplementation is needed, and if that part is substantial, temporarily using Looker Studio might be a viable option

- There is no data source available for **Budget & Projection** in Looker
    - In the long term, register it under the KPI project and manage it across all Trades -> Migrate it to **Looker**
    - In the short term, select the desired charts and implement them using **Looker Studio**

- Supply & Demand
