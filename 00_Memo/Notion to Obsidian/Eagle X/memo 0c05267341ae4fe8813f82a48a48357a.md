1.

For future planning, though, may I know how much it would be if I were a senior manager?

I am currently engaged, this marriage status is referring to  Success Factor's? Until when do I need to complete the process to get as ‘Marriage’

2.

Yes my contract expires June 30, so I can sign next contract starting from April 30, and it will be confirmed on April 1 whether that contract will be for 1 year or 2 years, is that correct?
