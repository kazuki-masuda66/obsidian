Hi Cheryl,

Good morning. Thank you for the information\!

First of all, I am going to create ONE's Gmail account.

Could you please give me a list of the first and last names of the members

who will be participating in this PJ?

As for the social network accounts, we may have to contact the

communications team to get them to execute it. (We will try to coordinate

as much as possible to see if we can do it directly, e.g., by setting up

permissions).

Thanks & Regards,

Kazuki Masuda

Hi Cheryl,

Thank you for your email\!

Let me ask you the following questions.

   1\. We have issued ONE workplace account (XXX@one-line.com). Is it

   possible for you to set up the account on your PC? or do you need ONE's PC

   to set it up?

   2\. Regarding Google ads and Google analytics account, can we use the

   above XXX@one-line.com account instead of  mcc@dp.sg?

   3\. Is there any reason why we would use quickmail instead of the

   campaign monitor we are currently using as an EDM platform?

   4\. If we also use the campaign monitor, do we need to have a Campaign

   Monitor account for Prodigy?

   5\. We had a meeting with the communication team about virtual accounts

   on LinkedIn, and they pointed out to us that this is not possible due to

   LinkedIn policy. Do you know anything about this? Any examples from other

   companies?

Thanks & Regards,

Kazuki Masuda

受信: Mon May 08 2023 16:58:11 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Cheryl Wan \<cheryl@dp.sg\>  
Hi Masuda-san,

Kindly refer to my answers below in blue:

   1\. We have issued ONE workplace account (XXX@one-line.com). Is it

   possible for you to set up the account on your PC? or do you need ONE's PC

   to set it up? For this, please help us to check with your IT department

   whether it's possible for us to log into a one-line account via our PC. Do

   let us know if you need anything else from us\!

   2\. Regarding Google ads and Google analytics account, can we use the

   above XXX@one-line.com account instead of  mcc@dp.sg?  For Google Ads

   and Google analytics we would prefer if you could give permissions to

   mcc@dp.sg but if that is not possible then we can proceed with the

   account you provide for us.

   3\. Is there any reason why we would use quickmail instead of the

   campaign monitor we are currently using as an EDM platform? If we also use

   the campaign monitor, do we need to have a Campaign Monitor account for

   Prodigy? We will not be able to reply to leads using campaign monitor so

   it's more preferable for us to use quickmail instead.

   4\. We had a meeting with the communication team about virtual accounts

   on LinkedIn, and they pointed out to us that this is not possible due to

   LinkedIn policy. Do you know anything about this? Any examples from other

   companies? There's a few workarounds we can do to create virtual

   accounts (creating new email addresses and even phone numbers). We'll be

   happy to touch on this further on Friday. Here's an example of a virtual

   account that another company has used:

   https://www.linkedin.com/in/leon-chief-metaverse-officer-publicis/ It's

   more of a mascot than a "person" but it's something we can consider as well.

Hope this helps\!

Many thanks,

cheryl wan

Hi Cheryl,

Thank you for sending the contract documents.

We will check it and get back to you soon.

Also, thank you for the video of virtual LinkedIn profiles.

I got 1 question from the communication team about how to add the Prodigy

account.

Could you please answer this question?

\++quote++

 Facebook and Instagram

I have found a segment on Facebook which only allows ad access (please see

screen capture attached). Could I confirm if this should be the function or

if it should be the Partner Access Tab?

Thank you for your clarification regarding the Facebook access.

We should use the partner access tab for adding our Facebook access. The

The screenshotted one is for access for individual accounts.

Dear Cheryl,

Thanks for the documents.

Let me have one small change request and one clarification.

1\. Could you change the our company name to be the official one\* "Ocean

Network Express Pte. Ltd." instead of "\*\*Ocean Network Express"\* for all

documents?

2\. Regarding the acquisition of e-mail address from Zoominfo, firstly just

to reconfirm the approach of purchasing of e-mail is legal.(I believe so)

     And I remember you mention this is one of common question receiving

from customer (why you know my account?), so can you give us such answer

examples how you usually explain to customer?

     I also remember you could provide as such operational questions &

answers list of Citrix ? example.

Would appreciate your kind support.

Regards

Shogo Otsuka

Hi Marc and Cheryl,

Sorry for cancelling tomorrow's meeting at the last minute.

Is it possible to change to one of the following?

23 May (Tue) 0900am-1000am

23 May (Tue) 1500pm-1700pm (1 hour)

\*Face to face session at Marina One office

Also, regarding the virtual account of LinkedIn, we understand there 2

options.

1\. Create genuine-looking accounts-\> Create accounts with a name that

really sounds like they're in Vietnam, India or Taiwan.

2\. Create avatar accounts that are clearly not real like Leon Avatar

Which would you recommend in our digital marketing initiative?

Thanks & Regards,

Hi Otsuka-san,

Apologies for the late reply, and thank you for your patience.

Kindly find the updated items attached \- please don't hesitate to reach out

if more changes are needed.

Yes, the acquisition of e-mail addresses from Zoominfo is legal. When it

comes to replying customer's emails on how we got their email addresses \-

first, we'll check if they've engaged with our ad assets earlier on in the

campaign (if yes, then we'll just let them know that they have interacted

with our ad assets). Otherwise, we can let them know that it is a

prospecting email and our database provider has provided a list of accounts

that might benefit from ONE QUOTE and have identified them as the most

suitable contact to try it out. We'll have to tighten the final response a

bit more based on how the POCs might answer but that's the general idea.

Kindly find a few of the operational questions & answers list of Citrix

attached for your reference. Hope this is helpful.

Many thanks,

cheryl wan

No worries about it. Yes, 23 May (Tue) 1600pm-1700pm works great for the

While both options might have different pros and cons, we would

## Sales Checklist review

受信: Wed May 03 2023 08:00:00 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Makoto Ohmi \<makoto.ohmi@one-line.com\>  
Hi All,

PwC has drafted the idea of Checklist enhancement considering the proposal

from Ben in previous call as per link below.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ncY81tYmR0JcbExDhXZO6jSbFWbexRGFELD4HKoCfC4/edit\#gid=523332967

On top of that, we are receiving some requirements from LA//EUA RHQ through

the E2E trial so let's have a brainstorming session to discuss what we

should enhance for the moment with putting priority.

Would appreciate if you could share the summary of requirement list.

Best Regards

## Virtual Office Arrangement \- Next actions

受信: Tue May 02 2023 08:00:00 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Kenichi Michida \<kenichi.michida@one-line.com\>  
\*To : GHQ Business Owners in this VO scheme\*

\*Kondo san, Kugoh san, (SQA and WM)\*

\*Nakai san, Ohmi san, Yoojin (Eagle X, CM analysis, Surcharge Maintenance)\*

\*Imai san, Masuda san, (SNOW, BF and BOMS)\*

\*Otsuka san, (Digital Marketing)\*

cc : SYM/DYM Leaders

Thank you very much for your interview and valuable feedback.

After further discussion with each country head and management, almost all

arrangements have been completed except the pending items as follows.

ONE India (2 FTE) : Waiting for the final confirmation on our counter

proposals of task assignments

ONE Taiwan (1 FTE) : The interview will be planned on either 3rd or 5th May

Taking this opportunity, I would like to express my sincere thanks for your

good contribution.

\[image: image.png\]

As the next step, we will be required to arrange the following activities

for smooth onboarding arrangement. Hence, I would appreciate it if you

could approach each applicant with some key stakeholders in each country.

You can refer to the stakeholders name in the file as attached.

Below are the expected activities for preparation and execution. You can

start from 1\) for better preparation before execution starts.

You can also refer to the attached file for better understanding.

\*(Coming activities)\*

Preparation

1\) Kick off session (on-line) for introduction in both sides

2\) Confirmation of onboarding date and timing of business trip schedule to

Singapore

3\) Detailed task assignment idea preparation (before the onboarding)

4\) Onboarding program and schedule preparation except common items

5\) 1st Appraiser (GHQ) assignment

6\) KAR and Targets preparation during the onboarding sessions

Execution

7\) Execution start

8\) Daily catch up session with each VO member by GHQ Business Owners

(individually) until the situation is stabilized

9\) Weekly status update session among GHQ by Michida & GHQ Business Owners

until the situation is stabilized

10\) Monthly feedback session to each VO member by GHQ Business Owners

11\) Monthly sharing session with country stakeholder by GHQ Business Owners

12\) Quarterly review session with each country head and stakeholder by

Michida

Supplemental information

8\) Daily Catch Up session between GHQ business owners and VO members for

better alignment. Of course, if they have any issues and unknown parts, you

should communicate with them on an ad-hoc basis. In addition, it should be

better to set up a kind of wrap up or morning check up session (it's up to

your decision) for good communication. It aims not to isolate them from

your team members. I believe this should be considered one of important

alignment schemes to keep the good motivation and solidarity. Hope you can

continue to conduct the sessions until you are confident to keep the tight

relationship.

9\) Weekly status update session among GHQ by Michida and GHQ Business

Owners : It aims to share the situation for everyone's good and quick

realization based on each feedback. It should be a kind of information

sharing. Of course, if any issues happen, then we can come up with the

countermeasures and solutions in cooperation with each country's

stakeholder. Before the execution starts, we can use this meeting slot for

the status check-up of preparation.

10\) Monthly feedback session to each VO member by GHQ business Owners : Not

only the assigned tasks but also any other workload or other HR matters can

be touched on. I would appreciate it if you could initiate the talk in

order to engage more. If necessary, some sensitive matters can be escalated

to my or each country's stakeholder.

11\) Monthly sharing session with country stakeholder by GHQ business Owners

: After the session 10), you can set up the individual session with each

country's stakeholders for good communication and alignment. They may be

able to share some key information pertaining to the work environment and

mental matters. If you have any outstanding issues from this session,

please escalate to me.

12\) Quarterly review session with each country head and stakeholder by

Michida : This can be held quarterly (either online or F2F) for better

alignment with each country head.

I will call the explanation session separately. If you have any questions,

feel free to ask me

\*Hi Huda,\*

I would appreciate it if you could convert the excel file to google sheet

for everyone's easy access which can be stored in the google drive.

In addition, please arrange the weekly session to invite the GHQ business

owners as above (listed members with bold in this message). 30 mins should

be fine. Thursday or Friday is preferred. But, if it's not good for

everyone's schedule, you can select other alternative slots. You can set it

from this week onwards up to the end of July at least.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.

Best regards,

Mitch

Noted below and we will follow up accordingly.

Let me ask one question, are we going to give the "Title in GHQ" to each VO

member?

Kondo san,

Thank you for pointing it out.

In theory, the title is not a mandatory base. Because they belong to the

local office from the HR perspective.

If you need some temporary tile for good coordination with other

stakeholders, we can consider.

Best regards,

Mitch

Michida san,

Thank you for your confirmation.

I don't stick too much on the title itself, but just wondered which is

better for future communication

both internally and externally since some of the VO members may have higher

title in local office,

but could be in the reporting line under the lower title holder in GHQ.

Anyway, it's ok at this moment.

Thank you.

Dear RHQ Heads and GHQ HODs,

On behalf of the management, we are pleased to announce that GHQ Board has

set the company goals and specific targets for FY2023 as follows.

We appreciate your kind cooperation to adopt and cascade them to each

region, country and department as per past year’s practice.

\*Company Goals (Overall) :\*

\*1. FY2023 Budget Achievement and Operational Excellence\*

\*Management has set an internal target for FY23 as USD1.2bil profit. As

logistics bottlenecks are normalizing and the market situation is

challenging in FY23, we all need to focus on any yield betterment, cost

minimization and increase of productivity to the achievement of this

internal target.\*

\*2. Business Execution in accordance with ONE's Mid-term plan\*

\*Following ONE’s Mid-term plan, firm actions must be taken in all business

areas to ensure ONE is a leading company in the industry and a trusted and

sustainable partner of stakeholders.\*

\*Specific targets:\*

\*3: Yield Maximization\*

\*We need to seek any opportunities to increase the lifting volume to make

our capacity and dead weight full and down as well as increase CM per TEU

to contribute to our bottom line.\*

大塚さん

こちらの反応遅くなりすみません。

念のための確認ですが、下記が私のタスクという認識でよろしいでしょうか。

・Comとの打ち合わせ設定

→Social Networkアカウントの運用について確認

・BPITとの打ち合わせ設定 with Kimmy & JS

→Landing page等を運用する際にドメインの付与等のタスクが発生することを予め周知

・Prodigyに向けメール

→契約書や彼らの宿題について依頼メールします。お手数ですが、前回説明いただいたPPTを共有いただけないでしょうか？PJの大枠ということで彼らにも共有できればと思います。

また、PJとして立ち上がっていくにあたって今後週次、もしくはBiweeklyくらいで内部の定例を設定してもよろしいでしょうか。

まずはインドやベトナムのメンバーが入ってくる前に大塚さん、Kimmy、YiiRui、私を想定してますが、なにかご意見がありましたらお願いします。

よろしくお願い致します。

おはようございます。

本件ご多忙の折フォローアップくださいましてありがとうございます。

全くもってほぼ当方で想定しておりましたイメージ通りにサマリー頂いており、実質的に当方からの補足等はございませんが、青地付記させて頂きます。

なお、先週金曜日に、SAS RHQ(GTL, Suet, Jonatha)/EAS RHQ (Kevinについては先日のハイレベルな資料ですが、

内容の頭出し及びカントリーヘッドへのこちらからのアプローチについても口頭ベースですが、頭出しは完了しております。

引き続きよろしくお願いいたします。

増田さん、

こちらフォローアップくださりありがとうございます。

別電当方から道田さんへの返信の通り、Prodigyへのコンタクトの際には会議の際にもテイクアップされた’’Local Focal

point"を各国でアサインできた際に想定されるR\&R(ProdigyとのE-mail

定例についてはご提案の通りセットアップをお願い致します。この中で各人のTo doを詳細化していきましょう。

超ご多忙ですのでスケジュール調整の際にはまずは下記参加者のスケジュールでスロット調整ご考慮いただければと思いますが、Invitationには走り出しの間は道田さんもOptionalで追加頂けますと幸いです。

道田さん、

明日のタッチポイントでもクイックに触れさせていただければと思いますが、下記2点につきUpdateさせて頂きたく。

\*1.契約書締結及び社内承認手続きについて\*

ProdigyとのPOCに向けProcurement Approval及び契約書締結のステップを進めさせて頂きたく。

現在BPIT, COMと諸々並行して確認、準備を進めておりますが、POC実施に向けての書類を以下3通ドラフトとして受領しております。（先方サイン済み）

当方の方でも一通り目を通させて頂き、MSAやSOWに記載されているサポート範囲やコストの見積もりといった肝の部分の内容に関しては、これまでの議論と相違ない旨確認しておりますが、

DPAに関してはGeneralな内容に見えるものの、正直当方でもReviewしかねることもあり並行してBPITになにか気になる点はあるかというような形で投げかけているというステータスです。

1.MASTER SERVICE AGREEMENT (MSA)

2.STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)

3.Data Processing Addendum(DPA)

上述の状況を踏まえまして以下の点につき、確認させていただけますと幸いです。

\*(確認ポイント）\*

1\. PJ担当者の窓口は大塚と増田さんの両名、（もし一名で、ということであれば当方の名前を使用する）

2\. 契約書のSigner/InvoiceのToはPwC同様道田さんとさせて頂いてよいか。

3\. PA (procurement

approval)手配に当たり、彼らの見積もり$74,800に対し、追加の手打ちの可能性等も考慮し$100,000を前提に挙げさせて頂く方向で良いか。

もし上述3点を提案の方向性で進めてよろしければ各所との最終確認及び準備と並行してシステムでのPA上程を進めさせて頂こうと考えております。

ご多忙の折恐縮ですが、よろしくお願いいたします。

\*2.Local 担当者に求められる役割について\*

口頭でもインプットさせていただきましたが、先方とも確認しDigital Marketing

POCにおけるサポートとして求められることは現時点で以下の3点で、

先日の道田さんからCountry head向けにご発信頂いたものとほぼ同様ですが、こちらで確認が取れております。

1\. EDMやSNSによるアプローチ後のフォローアップ、メール対応(問い合わせ対応）

2\. POC初期セットアップサポート

ー顧客リストのSanitary check（Target ListはGHQとProdigyで作成）

ーVirtual Accountの”想定”Profile 案（名前、Job title)

ーPromotion messageのTranslationサポート

3.週次定例報告Meetingへの参加およびFeedback 共有

\*(確認ポイント）\*

担当者のOnboardとガイダンスの進め方の目線合わせ。（まずは英文でのHead向けご発信から？）

道田さん、

本日はお時間いただきありがとうございました。

ご相談の通り来週のキックオフセッションに向け、台湾側のDigital Marketing

窓口のNominationをお願い申し上げたく、よろしくお願いいたします。

\*Local 担当者に求められる役割について\*

口頭でもインプットさせていただきましたが、先方とも確認しDigital Marketing

POCにおけるサポートとして求められることは現時点で以下の3点で、先日の道田さんからCountry

head向けにご発信頂いたものとほぼ同様ですが、こちらで確認が取れております。

1については先ほどご説明の通り窓口\*ご担当の実名アカウントをベース\*で使用する方で進めることを考えております。

1の部分のTransactionが未知数なことと、２の部分の一過性部分で6－7月は比較的多めのFTEを消費するイメージになる可能性はありますが、1FTEまでは見込んでおらずいっても0.5FTEといったところかと。様子を見ながら4、5のようなMarket情報の収集やデータ分析、レポートも徐々にタスクしていければとは考えています。

\*1. 該当国におけるDigital Marketing\*活動実行のサポート\*。

具体的には担当名でのDirect Mail 発信やSNS広告発信サポート、アプローチ後のフォローアップ、メール対応(問い合わせ対応）

＊GHQ PJ及び第三者ベンダーの方で常にモニタリング、代替応答のサポートも予定

\*2. POC初期セットアップサポート\*

ー顧客リストのSanitary check（Target ListはGHQとProdigyで作成）

ーDigital Marketing 用のSNSアカウントや準備サポート

ーPromotion messageのTranslationサポート

\*3.週次定例報告Meetingへの参加およびFeedback 共有\*

4.(sub to) Online market情報の収集

5.(sub to) 各国のデータ分析、レポート作成

\*予定されているOnboarding会議（さらなる追加、変更）\*

Kick off session 6月6日   ：1－2時 PM (SGT)

Weekly Regural call 6月12日～   : 以下いずれかの枠で検討中。すべてSGT表記。

ー火曜日1600-1700 ー金曜日1300-1400 ー金曜日1600-1700

Ad hoc sesison  6月21－23日      ：時間スロットの詳細は未定ながら、7月からの実行に向けVN/IN/TWで合同セッションを予定

以上、よろしくお願いいたします。

\*2. Inland offer: \*The same applies to the "Inland Y Condiciones" sheet. I

couldn't find any remarks added by the pricer to this sheet to support our

inland cost proposal.

Please, see below last year's proposal sent by ONE. All the remarks below

\*3. "Proposal" sheet \- free time (columns J-M): \*Just for the sake of good

Hi Ohmi san / Masuda san,

In time, please note that the topics raised in my last email sent to Benhur

regarding Nippon Suisan E2E trial are related to the items below previously

discussed.

During the consolidation stage (and after revising the consolidated file

received from CST), in the cases where the account manager identifies the

need of returning the tender for the pricers' double-check/revision in the

same round of negotiation, how should this be done?

Did you have the chance to revisit the SOP in order to establish a

validation/review process for these cases?

Noted with thanks, Benhur.

Dear Cristobal,

cc.: BR Marketing team as well

I understand that the pricers remarks are a key aspect to composing ONE

proposal for the tenders.

Please, let us better discuss/coordinate during the Eagle X rollout here in

Sao Paulo how the pricers remarks can be added to the pricing tool for the

CST team to be able to add them to the customer's file at the time of the

tender consolidation.

Dear \*Ohmi\*-san,

Thanks for sharing overall updates.

   \- UAT: Thanks for your prompt action in creating the UAT environment

   for JBS and NIDEC.

   \- Further conversion study: it may be that in the next tender season the

   customer's format eventually will change  ( in such case high care period

   is necessary during implementation phase )

   \- E2E Trial Session  \- Agree, let's evaluate the details in the next

   touch point session.

Best Regards.

\*Morning Masuda san,\*

Pertaining below accounts requested for end-to-end testing, allow me to

share our initial test findings:

\*a) Nippon Suisan (negotiated in Spanish)\*  \*(have test run on v39)\*

1\. Multiple Files (1 Reefer and 1 DRY File) \- \*Suggest to release Tender

file separately\* 2\. OTHERWISE,  it will need major file manipulation if

released in one shot

Totally different Requirement and Header Columns A. Have different

Surcharge Input Requirement (Reefer File requires OBS Input but in DRY File

it is NOT Required) B. Reefer File contains Calculated Field (TOTAL

FREIGHT) while in DRY File there is NO such Field C. Have different

FREETIME Input Requirement \- Reefer File requires FREETIME Input while in

DRY File FREETIME Requirement is in separate file D. Have different

Validity Requirements (Reefer requires 1 year validity while DRY requires

only 3 Mos) E. Have different Container Type/Size Requirements (Reefer

requires 1 20RF only while DRY requires 20FT/40FT/40HCD) F. DRY File

contains Empty Rows in between range (need to be removed) G. Different Data

Range alignment ( Dry file \- range starts at B17 while Reefer File \- range

starts at B7 \> will result to error in Union Tool) Please refer to this

file Link for more details:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XQjPJ0Jb6JpwMhzAj\_tA\_PZNFw8LkdzU/edit\#gid=932457442

b) Marfrig Global Foods (T\&C negotiated in Portuguese and rate sheet in

English). \*(not tested yet)\*

If Customer Format is still the same as below, then believe it should be

workable.

But for safety sake, may I ask you to share a copy of the latest customer

format for our testing \*(seems I don't have access to the below shared

file)\*

All,

I was thinking in the weekend that conversion of Marfrig Global foods is

not ready yet as Ben mentioned, so JBS may be good candidate for BR tender.

JBS's bid sheet includes some Portuguese and Marcelo is waiting for our

contract data update on this account so it should be good candidate for E2E

test/UAT.

How do you think?

Ohmi san,

Totally agree. Nippon Suisan is also a complicated case.

We should make a safe choice (JBS) since this is the first time to try the

End to End process.

( We can explain Spanish or Portuguese case separately, which Cassandra

wants to try)

Dear Ohmi san / Masuda san,

Sorry to jump-in,

Fortunately Flourance has access to the file and she is able to download it.

Anyhow, have taken a quick look at the file and believe that Marfrig Global

Foods is workable as well.

So we can have this one as a potential sample account as well.

Should we need to Test Run this on v40?

Masuda san, Ben,

We should better start LA E2E test from this week, so as of today 1\) JBS

and 2\) Nippon Suisan could be good candidates to proceed.

(However, pre conversion study for Marfrig Global Foods is required in

future, so it's not urgent but let's proceed conversion study same as other

accounts)

While the above 2 candidates' conversion study have been already done, we

need some prep/check before Cassandra starts initial check in as Ben

mentioned.

1\) Pricers address that we have to escalate (This time only LW/LE pricers

are enough)

2\) Test run on v40 (some updates have been added recently like group

calendar setting/R2 consideration so we should better check if script runs

correctly)

I headed up above points with PwC during our daily touch, so let me follow

up above 1\) / 2\) by this Wed, reverting.

Best Regards

In time, and in addition to my previous message, I would like to propose a

3rd account for the E2E trial (highlighted in purple below).

This one is an irregular case, to be under the Simplified format.

\*1.\* E2E Trial: I would like to propose the 2 accounts below for this

exercise:

a) Nippon Suisan (negotiated in Spanish)

b) Marfrig Global Foods (T\&C negotiated in Portuguese and rate sheet in

English).

c) Nova Era Silicon (tender details shared on March 05th).

Thanks. Please, let me know your thoughts about that.

Hi Cassandra,

Thanks for your update including the latest tender account summary.

For E2E candidate accounts, noted your preference but some of them we are

still conducting pre conversion study so it may require some time for data

preparation.

So let us propose the following accounts for this week's E2E trial.

LW: Nippon Suisan (DRY)

LE: JBS

\*For Nippon Suisan, format of customer sheet is different among DRY/RFR so

in actual tender we have to conduct Conversion and Pricing for DRY/RFR

respectively but this time objective is to align the whole process so let

us proceed for DRY only

\*JBS includes some Portugues in customer sheet so they could be a good

Hi Ohmi san,

Thanks for your return. Please, find my comments highlighted in blue as

follows:

For E2E candidate accounts, noted your preference but some of them we are

still conducting pre conversion study so it may require some time for data

preparation.

So let us propose the following accounts for this week's E2E trial.

CP: My idea was to perform the E2E trial for some of the tenders that are

going to be released in May. But I understand.

LW: Nippon Suisan (DRY)

\*For Nippon Suisan, format of customer sheet is different among DRY/RFR so

in actual tender we have to conduct Conversion and Pricing for DRY/RFR

respectively but this time objective is to align the whole process so let

us proceed for DRY only

CP: Nippon Suisan DRY is negotiated as spot biz. on a quarterly basis, thus

not considered as a tender (is no longer showing in the GCSM tender

calendar).

I suggest considering Nippon Suisan REEFER instead. This is negotiated on

annual basis and the tender should be released in May as well.

Please, refer to the attached tender files, just in case. Kindly confirm if

this one can be considered instead.

LE: JBS

\*JBS includes some Portugues in customer sheet so they could be a good

candidate to proceed.

CP: Indeed this is a good candidate and we could consider this one for the

E2E. My only concern is that the negotiation of this tender has just been

finalized and I was expecting to already touch on some a/c that is about to

be released. If not a possibility though, I agree to consider JBS.

As soon as possible, I would like to also work on an E2E trial for a tender

with no fixed format. This way, I can understand how to handle the

Simplified format as well.

Best Regards,

Hi Cassandra,

Thanks for your agreement.

After this time trial, we can consider conducting other bids as UAT

flexibly so for this week let us focus on below 2 accounts.

For Nippon Suisan, duly noted yours. Let's proceed \*with REEFER bid\*

instead of DRY.

For JBS, noted your point but it could be a good comparison with as-is

process and we would also like Pricers to know how they can receive

information in the Pricing Tool.

File could be prepared by tomorrow morning your time so we will let you

know details shortly.

Best Regards

Hi Flourance,

Sure. Please, find my comments marked in blue:

1\. We are unable to retrieve contract information for Anglo American and

Klabin. As per OPUS, they are not Contract Customers.

Please counter check and advise the Customer status.

Although ONE has been quoting these tenders for a couple of years

(specially Klabin), we've never received an award volume from them, thus

there is no SC/RFA valid for these accounts yet.

But it doesn't mean that we won't place our offer/participate of their

tender at the time those are released by the customers.

Please, advise if any impact on the conversion/pricing tool applicability

in these cases.

2\. Unable to retrieve Contract\# SAO20T0144. Please counter check and advise

the correct Contract\#.

Please, disregard the SAO20T0144 and consider only the contract

\# SAOB01887A for Minerva. Thanks.

Hi Cassandra,

As for JBS, we have completed the conversion and asked you for the review.

Please check and send it back to us.

\[image: image.png\]

Also, let me ask 1 question about the LA conversion study.

All the tenders highlighted in Yellow belong to AGRICOLA ARIZTIA tender.

It means that all the formats are the same with AGRICOLA ARIZTIA? If so,

studying AGRICOLA ARIZTIA tender is enough.

Hi Masuda san,

Sorry, but we hadn't finalized the Conversion

Checklist\_BR\_G-BR102268\_R1\_seq01

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eWiUaIiGxq6Gi8wG83ENlnvPA7ZG\_MXAdTIspR7zxDA/edit\#gid=279806227\>

for

JBS tender yesterday.

Since there were many details to be inputted for this tender in the

conversion checklist file (especially because this is negotiated in

Portuguese) we concluded this step and submitted it to CST today,

as per the screen below:

\[image: image.png\]

Please, can you coordinate with CST to review it and work on the conversion

based on this completed version and confirm it by return?

Also, please can you confirm that CST should only start working on the

conversion process after the account manager (sales) pushes the "Submit to

CST" button? Otherwise, we run the risk of dealing with rework

Regarding Agricola Ariztia, per C-KAM confirmation, there is only one

tender process (under Agricola Ariztia account \= 1 single format) and the

remaining customers (per below list) are shippers affiliated with Agricola

Ariztia's contract (RFA).

As for the SC, each shipper signs its own with ONE but based on the same

rates/negotiation agreed upon through Agricola Ariztia tender.

Hi Cassandra,

Thank you for submitting the checklist.

Taking into account the checklist, we've just resubmitted JBS to you.

Please check it and forward it to the pricer.

In other regions, since sometimes Sales forget to submit the checklist, in

that case, CST waits 1 day and submits the conversion result to Sales.

But, as you point out, it is possible to have CST wait strictly to conduct

the conversion until the checklist is submitted. Please give us your

opinion on that.

Thank you for the information about Agricola Ariztia.

Thanks & Regards,

Kazuki Masuda

Thanks, Masuda san.

1\. I have reviewed it, added my comments, and sent it back to CST.

\[image: image.png\]

2\. Understood regarding sales forgetting to submit the checklist. Thanks

for sharing it.

My view (at least for LATAM) is that CST should wait for the sales to

submit the checklist to conduct the conversion. This way, we avoid any

rework.

And we'll make sure to highlight this to the salespeople during the

rollout sessions in our region.

Best Regards,

Hi Flourance,

Sorry for my belated reply on checking the \*Conversion

Checklist\_LA\_G-LA654321\_R1\_seq01 (Grupo Nutresa)

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mkmT5ts98W\_gVBR\_A-zecqOGRtsTMEato7RAxXnET\_U/edit\#gid=279806227\>\*

.

Please, see in the g-sheet my comments and/or updates added in red font.

Taking the opportunity, I would like to check if it's possible to add a new

line to the checklist file (as topic \# 7\) naming it "\*Sales \- Additional

Remarks\*".

The idea is to leave it for the sales to add any complementary info.

related to the customer's rate sheet, as per the example below.

The details below marked in red also refer to the Grupo Nutresa rate sheet

and are mandatory to be completed at the time of quotation. I couldn't find

any field to mention them in the current format of the checklist file.

I appreciate your check and return.

\# Question/Topic Details ① Check Box ② Reference Column in Tender Sheet

\*Optional ② Customer Request Remarks

If you have any supplemental comments to CST, please input this cell.

7 Sales \- Additional Remarks Column Y: Number of transshipment ports (as 0,

1, 2, etc);

Column AC: Total Transit time;

Column AE: Service Frequency (as weekly, bi-weekly, etc);

Column BH: Pricer remarks.

## Fwd: DX Rollout/Training plan

受信: Tue Mar 14 2023 09:00:57 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Makoto Ohmi \<makoto.ohmi@one-line.com\>  
道田さん、植田さん

昨日のGSE Updateでも少し触れさせていただきましたが、各RHQ、MNL（+HKG?）の訪問スケジュールを各地と調整し始めております。

LAからは5月末が希望と来ているものの、Eagle-X/APのインプリの観点ですと、このタイミングだとちょっと遅いこともあり、4月末か5月頭で調整出来ないか聞いてみようと思います。

ただ、他のRHQとの絡みもありますので、スケジュールに加えて、誰がどこに行くのかも含め調整したいと思います。

また素案が固まりましたら共有させていただきます。

Subject: DX Rollout/Training plan

To: Makoto Ohmi \<makoto.ohmi@one-line.com\>, Go Imai \<go.imai@one-line.com\>

Cc: Mauricio Campello \<mauricio.campello@one-line.com\>

Dear \*Ohmi-\*san, \* Imai-\*san

As per last conversation there are 3 main projects to be rolled out soon (

EagleX/Price too, Account Plan, SNOW)

Those projects are being managed at RHQ level at this system preparation

stage (eventually we are involving some countries to brush-up the tool).

In the second stage we will prepare a plan for rollout to FOs , below is

our current strategy.

a) To  have a common session with FOs to connect DX projects and rollout

(very difficult for each country to catch-up those projects Individually).

b) To consider split sessions between West Coast (Chile) and East Coast

(Brazil) to accommodate the attenders and focus on localization issues.

By considering GHQ's participation (Visit to LA) for supporting us (which

will be extremely helpful), we need to consider some alternative plans as

below

  \*Agenda proposal \*

\[image: image.png\]

Ps. I highlighted in yellow the best option for LA, considering agenda

conflicts with  each RHQ Members/ FOs to attend.

I guess for GHQ's will be also a challenge to visit LA due to short notice.

\*Possible delay of the project.\*

I understand the importance of speed up to the implementation to achieve

primary goal from GHQ, but considering different stakeholders involved,

eventually we need to consider to postpone (eg. 1 month) in order to be

more assertive in the conduction to the end users.

Could you please evaluate our consideration and return ?

Best Regards.

Hi Thiago,

Thanks so much for your coordination at LA RHQ side and noted your

preferable date as below. (noted end May is the most preferable for LA)

While I'm checking the schedule of DYM other members, timing wise slight

earlier timing would be better from AP/Eagle-X perspective.

So, would like to check if arranging the session in the end of Apr, Or beg

of May timing will be feasible or not.

Appreciate your confirmation, we will also check our schedule and keep you

updated.

Best Regards

\*Dear Ohmi-san,\*

Thanks for your feedback.

The main point is the Key members from RHQ Tender Management will be on

vacation.

There are 5 potential Tenders to be received in MAY ( as countermeasure  we

can manage those potential customers at RHQ level and use as example during

UAT with FOs "Local Sales")

Thiago,

Sorry for our belated reply.

After internal discussion, we'd like to visit LA RHQ in the end of May and

have discussion for Eagle-X, SNOW and AP taking this opportunity.

However, visiting both Sao Paulo and Chile could be quite tight to cover

all the agenda so can you consider having session in Sao Paulo with

inviting colleagues in Chile?

Also, please kindly review if following schedule is workable for LA team.

   \- 18-19th May: SNOW

   \- 22-23rd May: Eagle-X

   (24th May could be buffer for either Eagle-X or AP)

   \- 25-26th May: AP

Best Regards

\*Dear Ohmi-san,\*

Thanks for your submission.

The main proposal is to have different sessions to give the opportunity to

invite more people based on project type.

But I understand schedule issues, I will coordinate it from our side.

My recommendation is  to change the order and start with \*Eagle X\* ( We

will consider inviting super users from \*Sales\* for this specific project),

order projects under space management (AP/SNOW) . There's a different team

involved under \*commercial steering\*.

We are flexible to change the order as you proposed so we can start from

Dear Thiago,

After 23&24 of the SNOW session, we expect users to use SNOW.

So we are considering having daily touchpoints on 25th & 26th as well to

support the SNOW operation.

(We already suggested this to Isadora)

So if possible, we would like the Panama T/S desk to come on 23&24th.

We would appreciate it if you would check it again with them.

Thanks & Regards,

Kazuki Masuda

Dear all

Thank you for your participation in the workshop.

Currently we are planning 74 attendees for the session and I noticed that

if many people join to Miro board as an anonymous user it causes some

confusion among attendees. Sorry for bothering you but I would like to ask

all attendees to create your Miro account in advance.

Please kindly see the link below and create your account prior to the

session.

受信: Mon Mar 13 2023 10:57:48 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Go Imai \<go.imai@one-line.com\>  
増田さん、田中さん、

水曜のプチ勉強会ですが、主に以下のアジェンダをカバーしたいと思います。特に2.はコンテナビジネスの本質的なポイントながらも、ONE全体でもこれを理解できているスタッフはほんのわずかという現実があります。恐らく学生時代以来に「連立方程式」を解いて頂こうと思いますので、電卓があるといいかも知れません。

   1\. CMとは？

   2\. EPCとは？

ご参考までに、当日使用する資料と実際のプライシング業務で起こりうる具体例（FOからのEPCに関する疑義の問い合わせ）について共有しておきます。詳細は当日触れるので、まずはお時間ある際にイメージアップのためにさっと眺めておいて頂ければと思います。

以上、

今井

シェアありがとうございます。いい資料ですね。微妙に私もわからない点もあり（消席が高くなるとvariable

costが上がるというのはなぜでしょうか。。。）、誰かに聞きたいところです。

昨日時間切れになってしまった連立方程式は、暇なときにホワイトボードを大きく使ってやってみてください。解けるとかなりスッキリして、EPCはマスターした気分になれると思います。

また何かプチ勉強会のネタがあればやりましょう。

お疲れ様です。

Status Listについて、こちら

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jHdoNA73ez26eBv1Q7jrrbbxj02nc9iPumuns1VbelA/edit\#gid=1503212636\>

のようにコンソリプロセスも追加してアップデートさせて頂きました。

Pricer 一覧を取得し、Status Listへ反映する点については、今週後半～来週にかけて実装予定ですが、

それ以外の箇所に関して、下記を中心にご確認いただけると幸いです。

・日数等の計算に関して下記で問題ないか

\- コンバージョンの1st Draft 期日はInitial-Checkin提出日＋1営業日

\- Pricerへの提出期日はInitial-Checkin提出日＋2営業日

\- 上記営業日は、祝日は考慮せず、土日は営業日にカウントせず

\- 残存日数は営業日ではなく、暦年における日数をカウント

・カテゴリーなどの並べ方について

現状は、

\- 01\_CST Pending ：CSTのプロセス待ちか

\- 02\_Need to Trace：Sales/Prierのアクション待ちか

で分けたうえで、残存日数を昇順にしております。

このあたりの見え方について、ご意見いただけると幸いです。

Would it be possible for you to obtain below tender files & save them here

\<https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1y0VD7eNm-10wQYcZYrabV4XX0M\_guBO0\>

rather than each individual trade saving/obtaining same files?

This year's tender files would be preferred but as they may not have been

released yet, last year's files are ok just for GHQ/TCT to test file

conversion feasibility. If possible please state which files are new/old

ones.

Thank you.

Dear Kasia , Adam and Alina,

Let me share Eagle X Q\&A sheet with you.

\*We have answered some questions from LA using this seet.

  The same question may apply to you so appreciate it if you could refer to

it.

Also, you can ask any questions about the end to end process in

tomorrow's session.

Thanks & Regards,

Dear Ohmi San,

I have added the remaining bids and as mentioned in the meeting:

   \- \*RFQ via email: \*Arla Foods via Go Forward, Tang Freres, Paris Store,

   MR Price, Tata Chemicals Magadi thus no bid sheet.

   \- T\*ang Freres, Paris Store, Action\* have switched to monthly deals and

   most probably this validity will be maintained.

   \- Tender release month as well as the number of rounds and rate validity

   (the validity may differ between the trades in the same bid sheet)  is

   completely different to 2022 and as 2023 EUA Tender season is close to the

   end we don't know what 2024 will bring.

Thanks/Best regards,

Thanks Alina for your summary and noted yours.

Also, understand releasing month/validity for 2024 bid shall be

gradually updated. Please keep us posted if any update on the tender

calendar.

While 2024 bid conditions would be unclear, we can consider to start pre

conversion for some tenders once ongoing pre conversion has been done so

please let us separately follow up with RSM/SYM on how to proceed.

近江さん、増田さん

お世話になっております。諸々下記ご確認いただけると幸いです。

なお、ご相談事項については、本日のテストも通してご確認させていただけると幸いです。

\*＝Testに向けた共有について＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝\*

共有すべき最新のツール等は下記となっておりますので、ご展開のほどよろしくお願いいたします。

・ Live version is v40

・Link of Google Form and Status list are follows;

\- Simplified Format Creation (G-Form

\<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc7n\_p8KuKvz1drTbptDA5tOUh5vGx8lpFJwfCwCOR\_LCfkVQ/viewform\>

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jHdoNA73ez26eBv1Q7jrrbbxj02nc9iPumuns1VbelA/edit\#gid=608057154\>

)

\*＝明日のHOを通してのTest対象ついて＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝\*

・今回のUAT対象について確認したところCustomer Sheetの最大は7,000行弱でした（Eagle X Scopeは1,200行程度）

・そのため、一旦テンプレートにおいても、Customer SheetのMaxを7,000行とし、その代わりにOPUS

Contractも7,000行程度まで増加させることで、OPUS Contractが多いときのエラーを回避しております

・その中で、今回のHOをつないでのテスト対象のMCSが候補と理解しておりますが、こちらOPUS

Contractが6,000行以上あるケースで、Contract のRetrieveに30分程度かかりそうです

・みんなで30分待つのはさすがに長い気もしたので、HOをつないでの対象をMurataに変更するのもありかな？と考えており、一度ご検討いただけると幸いです

（なお、Murataにすることで、ちょうど下記③の論点もそこでカバーできていいのかも？と考えたりもしました）

\*＝その他ご相談事項について＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝\*

\*①Pricer Assignに関して\*

昨日別途チャットでやり取りさせていただいておりますが、YUSENとMCSも追加したものにアップデート

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ynTkVof6MaYvBjKtHcCTvzcw-Hs\_TZ\_\_m\_K6b2gBNDo/edit\#gid=2057292104\>

しております。

変わりないと思いますが、念のためご確認いただけると幸いです。

なお、最新ツールでは、JP Otherが出た場合にはアラートが出るように変更しております。

\*②Pricing 依頼のメールに関して\*

下記につけている自動メールについて、多くの人を入れたのもあり、かなり見にくい形になってしまっております。。。

括弧内の相手の名前を削除するなど、どうするのがPricerにとって自分ごととして見えるか、ご相談させていただけると幸いです

\*③トレード別エクセルのマニュアルでの統合について\*

トレードごとにエクセルを抽出しているものを、CSTにマニュアルでエクセルを統合してもらうという話があったやに記憶しております。

こちら、ちょうど下記ケースがそれにあたるので、統合方法を議論できればと存じます

寺田

寺田さん

状況了解しました。30分はちょっと悩ましいですね。。

ただ、HOでの対象ですが、出来ればMCSを優先したいのですが、Contractの部分だけHOの中では便宜的に何か違う対応を取ってということは難しいでしょうか？

理由としては:

・ひとまずNAのRehearsal用にMCSがうまく回ることを今週中に確認しておきたい。

・JPNも来週から始まるということで急ぎというのは変わりないですが、基本Multi

Tradeということで、分けた後のPricingの部分で時間がかかってしまうので、Offlineで作業する方が好ましい。

・Multi Tradeのファイル統合（AE Domi/NonDomi、WA Domi/NonDomi、AFLA関連

Trade）についてはCSTにはきちんと話が出来ておらず、今日の時点ではちょっと難しいのと、これに合わせてPricing

Toolも統合したベースでのテンプレを用意する必要があり、今日時点ではこれも準備出来てないので、Offlineでやる際にはきちんと対応しようと思っております。

・Multi Tradeの統合はこのようにPricing ToolとのPackageになるので、私かFlouranceの方で、Eagle-X Team

Reviewの際にやろうかなとも考えております。JPNの対象Accountの中だと、統合が必要になるのは4-5社のため。ここは要相談ではありますが。

ご検討いただきたく、宜しくお願い致します。

近江さん、増田さん、

おはようございます。

横から失礼いたします。

\*①MCSのContract対応\*

本日のテストにおいては行数が少ない他Contractを便宜的に置き、Retrieveの動作を確認するということでいかがでしょうか。

具体的には、MCSのNYC0132B22（6685行）をStatus

ListやMaster上でOSAB00718A（188行）に変更しておき、HOでのConversion時には後者をRetrieveすることを想定しています。

\*②Pricing Toolのテスト\*

①にも関連しますが、本日の2時間のEagle X testではPricing Tool/Consolidation

Toolの動作もHOで皆で確認することを想定されていたか、遅まきながら念のため確認させてください。

実施する場合、

①の対応では正しいContractが紐づかないため、Conversion完了後、裏で正しいContractの情報に貼りなおすことを想定しています。

\*③Consolidation Toolのテスト\*

Consolidation ToolもHOでのテストを実施する場合、別チャットの通り、NikkoさんのPCでのエラーが解消できておりません。。

本日のHOでは動作を確認できた他のEagle X Support

Teamの方に確認してもらうのが良いかと思っておりますが、進め方につきご相談させてください。

（エラーを解消するため、テストで抑えている枠の最後にNikkoさんにお時間をもらい改めて画面共有をお願いしようと考えております）

また、Consolidation Toolの最新版につき、直前に大変恐縮ですが、共有させていただきます。

ご確認いただき、皆様にもご共有いただけますと幸いです。

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

I have uploaded the updated Consolidation Tool in this folder

\<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ABF6WC3X8iEAUk9PVA\>.

Please kindly refer to the updated points below:

1\. Search button

\- When there are no Pricer submission files yet, it will show an error

message "No files submitted from Pricer yet" and close

\- In case when no tender sheet is received in R2, it will search R1

converted files and R2 Pricer submission files

2\. Consolidate button

\- Customer Sheet Name can now be read properly; Consolidated files will

split the customer sheet into multiple sheets for customers with multiple

tender sheets

\*\*\*\*Attention: VBA recognizes whether the tender sheet needs to be split

into multiple sheets by the column V "Customer Sheet Name".\*

\*Conversion fils extracted before 02/13 have the column name "◎Customer

Sheet Name" which cannot be read by the updated tool.\*

\*Please manually erase "◎" on "CustomerSheet" sheet column V from the

extracted files if you used UNION tool before 02/13. Sorry for the

inconvenience\*

3\. TT Extraction button

\- "Ref) TT Data Fields" sheet is created for Sales to refer to the TT data

fields

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

よろしくお願いいたします。

実施する場合、

①の対応では正しいContractが紐づかないため、Conversion完了後、裏で正しいContractの情報に貼りなおすことを想定しています。

→MCSはTenderシートのLane数は非常に少ないので、Pricing作業自体もMRG+αということでよければ5-10分で完了するかと思います。

Contractの情報はなくても作業は進められますので大丈夫です。

近江さん、

早速のご確認ありがとうございます。

①および②について、承知いたしました。

仮のContractを紐づけたまま、Pricing Toolでテストいただければと思います。

③について、本番環境と揃えられず大変申し訳ないのですが、お願いできればと思います。

＞増田さん、

アップデート箇所は先ほどのメールの通りになりますが、もしお時間あればアップデート版で回るかをご確認いただけると大変幸いです。

MCSだと後程のテストファイルと被る可能性があるかと思いますので、G-JP106250のITOCHUでPricer Submission

Files含めテストファイルをFY23のフォルダで用意してみたのでよろしければ試してみていただければと思います。

※留意点として、TTマスタが拡張されているためTT Extractionボタンの時間が従来よりかかります（1000行で3\~5分ほど）。

よろしくお願いいたします。

先ほどはありがとうございました。

先ほどのPricingの状況をStatus Listにて捕捉する件について、2点下記共有させていただきます。

なお、下記②に関しては、後ほどのEagle X会議でも口頭でお話させていただくように致します。

\*①自動でのFolder 数取得について\*

・Folderから件数を取得するGASをR1で回すこと自体におおよそ10分弱かかります

・その中で現状は、15分バッチでGASを回すことにしているので、10分＋15分でアップデートまで25分程度と見積もっております

・現状はいったんR1のみを対象にしておりますが、R2も対象にした場合には少しずらしてRunさせることで上記15分のバッチ間で交互にRunできると考えております

R3をどうするか？はありますが、現状では上記から30分とお伝えした次第でした。ご不明な点等あれば何なりとご連絡ください

\*②Pricing の完了判断について\*

・こちらは、ピクチャのように、CQ列とCT列でフォルダ数を確認したうえで、推定でのStatusをCO列に表示しております

\[image: image.png\]

・ただしこれはあくまで推定なので、あえて最終ステータスとはせずに、CN列は最終的にManualでインプットする形にしています

・CN列にはデフォルトでは計算式が入っており、

\- CO列がNot Startedの場合はNot Started

\- それ以外の場合はIn Progress

が自動で入るようにはしております。

CR列まではコンバージョンツールにて管理しており、そこまではSubmitボタンにて記録できる状態なので、In

Progressになったか？は自動でとれる形なので、Pricerを待っている状態か？というのはCSTも自動で認識できるような作りとしております

増田さん、

スイマセン。本件、フォローアップを失念しておりました。

今回の提案は、ROOTプロジェクトとして管理してきた夫々のプロジェクトの進捗状況を包括的にシェアした上で、これまで実施してきた定期的なアップデートを停止しようという話になります。後か不幸か、TITANに就いてはBAUに入っているという扱いになっており、これまで特段報告を求められてきませんでしたが、今回その対象となっております。

で、ココからが本題ですが、先日ご相談しました通り、TITANのSunsetに向けた準備を進めていく必要があり、上述の会議はその端緒として丁度良いかと考えております。ここで、BAUで順調ですといった後で、数カ月後にTerminateします、というのでは筋が通りませんし。なので、詳細は決まっていないものの、ある程度大枠ですが、以下のアプローチで説明するような準備が出来れば、と思いますが、如何でしょうか？

①、過去の開発状況の推移

②、現状の活用状況

③、課題及びソリューション（すなわちEagle Xの状況）の現状

④、今後の方向性及び具体的なアクションの大枠（Terminationに向けた）

⑤、Lessors Learn（これは、当方が考えてみますが）

10分以下の割当になるかと思うので、概要のみで構いません。

また、時間的な準備もあるので、4月に振り替えてもらうように、SHに依頼してみます。

加えて、来週22日から24日にHKG出張を予定しており、その際に常松さんとCarmenと本件を話してこようと思っております。

出来れば、②と③に就いて、簡単に口頭でも結構ですので、ご教示頂けますと助かります。

宜しくご検討のほど、お願い申し上げます。

道田

Mitch

## Digital Marketing企業との検討アプローチについて

受信: Wed Feb 08 2023 10:48:29 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Shogo Otsuka \<shogo.otsuka@one-line.com\>  
（DYM定例でのご報告を検討しておりましたが、今週はキャンセルということでメールで失礼しております。）

道田さん、

(cc:増田さん）

掲題の件ですが、先日口頭でUpdateさせて頂きましたDigital

Marketing企業へのアプローチですが、先方の実施事例を入手しましたので添付共有させていただきます。

先日インプットの通り、同企業の事例のパターンとしてはSEOや外部ソリューションの導入等々、E-mail

marketing以外のものも掲載されております。

つきましては、さらなる検討を進めるに当たりONEから以下の条件をいわゆる見積もりの前提として、先方からの提案取得を勧めたいと考えております。

アプローチに関し、ハイライトさせていただきたいポイントといたしましては以下の通りです。

ー先方の推しはE-mail Marketingのようでしたが、あくまで我々としては方法論は広く検討していくため、あえてOpen

question形式で、Goal を達成するためのPlanning（Solutionは問わない）及び最適プランを求める。

ーBudgetについては、全くIndicationがないため「下記Goalを6ヶ月のPJTで達成するには」という投げ方で、先方からの掲示を先に出させる方向で検討を依頼。

ー並行して、他のDigital Marketing 企業との比較を行うべくCOM/BPITに同様の見積条件を念頭に、候補企業がないか聞き取りを行う。

ー1社日系で有名なTranscosmosという企業がSingaporeに拠点をもちかつデジタルマーケティングサービスを提供していることもあり、問い合わせ中。

あくまで見積もりを経た上で意思決定を勧めていくため、先方の出方次第で条件も見直しが必要になる可能性は高く、

現時点で大きなところで違和感等ないようでしたらまずは検討を転がしていければと考えております。

\*＜見積取得条件案＞\*

\*Goal/Out come expectation \*: Acquire New ONE QUOTE User with Booking

transaction by trying ditial marketing method

\*\*Trial Scope\* \*Country               \*:IN/TW/VN

\*\*\*Benchmark                           :15 % of New customer (no Short/OQ

transaction in 6 month)'s booking ex from 3 countries under OQ\*

\*Period    \*                                 :6 month (2 month

planning/preparation, 4 month experiment)

\*直近半年のデータを参照の上、一定数のVolumeがベースに存在し、かつ短期比率が高いがOQ比率が低いアジアCountryをターゲットとして3カ国選出

\*\*既存休眠顧客を対象とするのか、顧客数、あるいはTEUとするのか悩みましたがあくまでRevenu outputという観点で設定。

同三カ国を除いたOQ比率約2.8％をターゲットとして逆算する形で15％増とおいております。

必要に応じて、弊職も先方との会合等に参加しますので、その際はお気軽にお声がけ下さいまし。

## CMA Service \- Mobile app & CMA CGM+

受信: Mon Feb 06 2023 08:00:00 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Kenichi Michida \<kenichi.michida@one-line.com\>  
皆様、

以下のやり取り（CMAのWechat機能の照会）と、HPに記載のあるCMA

CGM+というサービスラインアップに就いてご参照ください。正直、これは由々しき事態かと。

矢張り、皆さん力入れて開発してますね。

当方の感じた点は以下の通りです。

CMA CGM Mobile Application に就いて（彼らのSpotOnに関しても）

①、Wechatの活用（中国向けに特化した仕掛け）

②、Sanction Check機能の実装

③、D\&D Price Finderの実装

④、Lock My Price Option（Offer Pricingの72時間延長）

⑤、Charge PaymentのSelection機能

⑥、Commodity PricingでのHS Codeの活用

これとは別に、知りませんでしたがCMA

CGM＋というサービスライナップを提供しておりまして、どこまで浸透しているかどうかは兎も角、これは相当先を行かれた感じです（というか、完全に置いていかれております）。非常に大きな危機感を覚えております。

皆さんにも一度ご覧いただきたいです。

Dear Jenny,

Just to share, here are some interesting input from ONE China about one of

other market player's UI about wechat mini app .

They have much integrated contents from their spot pricing (can access to

D\&D search etc) and well customized design.

This could be good reference for our upgrade in future.

I think we may need to work on API connection to Mobile APP for ONE QUOTE

for further upgrade and customization in future as well.

現在PendingになっておりますTOE (Tiger On E-comm)ですが、GCSMリードのNew

別途、またご相談させてください。

梁さん、

ご提案有難うございます。

こちらについては、先ずは他社の先行事例の検証から始めつつ、Front

Officeからの情報収集も進めた上で、Designの議論に入りたいと思います。このあたりの情報収集に就いて、大塚さんのチームで主導してもらいまして、それをベースにこのメンツで議論を進められれば、と思います。

その後開発に就いては、Tiger Projectの主導の上で、eCom teamやONE QUOTEと連携出来ればと思います。

道田さん、梁さん、

下記ありがとうございます。

ご指摘の通り、TOEについてはまずは他社の最新アプローチの分析及び関係者への聞き取りを行い、ONEとしてのアプローチを検討していきたいと思います。

下記のCMAですが、当初Online Quotationの先駆けで2018年頃からぶら下げ運賃をMSKより早くリリースして先に走っていたものの、

Spot platformの立ち上げではやや出遅れた格好となっていたのですが、昨年のSpot pricingプラットフォームリリースを機に、

加速度的にMSKあるいはそれ以上のラインナップを拡充しており、ご指摘の通り相当程度の開発リソースが張られたものと思料します。

触れていただいているCMA+についてはいまだOn Paperな機能も一部あるようですが,今回入手したDemoは実ProductionのUIということで、

実物を見る限りほぼラインナップ通り実装にまで至っていることは間違いなさそうです（添付Video 2:06 前後)

ECOM版のVideoも入手しておりますので合わせて展開させていただきます。

 CMA CGM online (1).mp4

\<https://drive.google.com/file/d/18NyHfyWtvLuiSK19Izlzdu8OW5-bigIf/view?usp=drive\_web\>

また、添付PDFご参考ですが、足元中国系のキャリアの機能拡充も足が早くなっております。

CMAとは少し異なりCOSCO/OOCLは中国エリアに特化した機能強化が見られることが特徴ですが、各社「入り口を作る」Phaseから「付帯Serviceの拡充、囲い込み」Phaseに完全シフトがしてきており、いわずもがなONEとしても同エリアへのさらなる対応強化が急務かと思います。

開発チームにも状況共有の上で、開発プランに織り込んで行きたいと思います。

\*As explained by Terada san, V34 begins with the input of a Google form.

Then you will get the V34 conversion tool(Google sheet) accordingly.

\*\<UAT test items\>\*

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BQUEgruKiKGg0wYH-HNrUL-lREk8rcSUt28uS7bTXvI/edit?hl=en\&forcehl=1\#gid=1160982162

\*Gray header area-\>Please confirm each process and task

\*Blue header area-\>Please confirm the Google drive you will use in each

task and communication route(Address, title, contents).

\*Magenta header area-\>Please update the test items to '2\_Complete' if the

process and task are OK. In the case of OMMC, please start and check from

1-2 Draft T\&C Summary and please communicate with Eagle X team when you

reach sales/pricer tasks using the communication route in the blue area.

\[image: image.png\]

\*If you have any issues and request some functions to tools, Please write

it in the QA sheet.

\*\<Process flow\>\*

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ieC4dpPL6\_u3ft13tXwCjQlweJFcH9df

\*Please confirm each flow and process.

\*\<Consolidation tool\>\*

We will provide the consolidation tool and SOP tomorrow.

Consolidation part is the end of the process, so please start from

conversion.

When you start to use the consolidation tool, we would like to provide

quick training just before, since this is the first time for you to use the

consolidation tool.

Let us have a touch point next week to confirm the situation.

But if you have any questions, please let us know anytime.

Dear TST/CST team,

Let me send the latest SOP for ver.34.

Also, let me supplement the sequence number in the Google form.

Usually this sequence number is used when there are multiple files needed

for conversion.

\[image: image.png\]

If this sequence number is duplicated with others, it will be an error

since we are using the same tender(LANXESS) file.

So if you face a duplication error, please try to use another sequence

number as below.

Eagle X team:11-20

OMMC:21-30

WNS India:31-40

CST:41-50

But anyway if you have no problem with the conversion tool, please continue

to use the current sequence number.

Please chat/email me anytime about UAT.

## 12月SingaporeでのEagle XのFollow upについて

受信: Mon Nov 28 2022 10:49:28 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Hiroshi Ueta \<hiroshi.ueta@one-line.com\>  
吉岡さん、杉本さん、佐久間さん、高橋さん、深井さん

GHQ SYMの植田です。Eagle Xについてお忙しい中ONE

Japan内でのImplementationについてご尽力いただいておりまして誠にありがとうございます。

走りながら進めているところもありまして、ご負担をおかけしておりますが、ONEとして非常に大きな成果が達成できると思っておりまして、何卒よろしくお願いします。

さて、先日からお話させていただいております本件のさらなるFollow upについてですが、可能でしたら12月中に2日ほどSingaporeにてFace

to

Faceで実施できればと思っております。吉岡さんのところとは以前からお話させていただいておりまして、吉岡さんand/or杉本さん＋佐久間さんでいらっしゃることを検討していただいておりますが、加えて全体のImplementation話をできたらと思っておりまして、可能でしたらJapan

SYMから高橋さんand/or深井さんにも同じタイミングでSingaporeにおこしいただければと思っております。以下がこちらが想定している内容となっておりまして、吉岡さんand/or杉本さん+佐久間さんにつきましては両日とも、高橋さんand/or深井さんは少なくてもDay２については参加いただければと思っております。内容も多岐に渡っておりまして、また細かいところも確認できればと思っておりますので、お忙しい中大変恐縮ですが、Singaporeへのご出張を検討いただければと思います。

目的：Eagle XのONE JapanでのImplementationにあたり、今後を見据えたCoversion tool／Pricing

toolの詳細共有並びに、現状のボトルネック確認・応用ケースへの対応検討。更には今年のONE Japan内でのImplementation

Planの詳細確認とこちらにいるJapan Pricersとのすり合わせ。

Day1（テクニカルな部分中心）

 \- ConversionについてSOPや実際Convetedされたものを見ながら、現状のボトルネックや不明点などを確認。更には日本語

が入って来るテンダーのフローや、BCO/NACでパッケージで見る場合の対応等を確認。

Day2（全体像やONE JapanへのImplementation Planが中心）

 \- 全体像とONE JapanへのImplementation Planのすり合わせ並びにこちらのPricerとのすり合わせ。

日程についてですが、ちょっとこちらのメンバーの日程も確認したのですが、できれば、以下の日程でと思っておりまして、ご確認いただければ幸いです。

（難しければおっしゃってください。）

\*日程：12月20日（火）、21日（水）終日\*

もし、OKということでしたら、宿泊の手配をさせていただきますので、メンバーとCheck in/Check outの日程をご教示いただければと思います。

明日の午前中に電話会議がありますので、そのときに必要でしたら確認させていただければと思います。

よろしくお願いします。

全体のテンダー数、内訳について先日別メール(件名 ONE Japan Tender

Overview)と打ち合わせの場で速報をご連絡しましたが、営業により未記入のものもありましたので最終的な数字は下記の通りとなりました。

詳細はこちらの\*Japan Tender List\*

\<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ktKCSc1WMbjKmvHosbyEFp1ontEAmSzIS9EFbQQlmyE/edit\#gid=1901453607\>

に纏めてあります。

全体の数字と20lane以上+customer formatの荷主・テンダー数を並べました。

\[image: image.png\]

20lane以上+customer formatのもの、つまりはOffshoreでConversionを行って頂くcandidateは

284テンダーとなります。

(荷主名はリストを参照ください)

BCO 85荷主 157テンダー

NVO 30荷主 127テンダー (内 NAC 112テンダー、non NAC 15テンダー)

\* non NAC とはメーカー系ロジ会社(eg Mitsubishi Electric Logisticis)です。

\* NAC 112テンダーの内、19のテンダーはBCO直貿とダブルものとなります。

合計 284テンダー

対象となる荷主の営業から共有シートを集め、追ってTender Relase月毎に整理したものをGHQ皆さんへ共有します。

来週中の連絡を目指します。

大塚さん、増田さん

今週火曜のONEJとのCallで、Processについては出来るだけ早く彼らにもDraftを展開して、

・Feedbackをもらって必要に応じてBrush upをかける（特にOnshore Case）

・JPN独自で必要なProcess（別途シェアした1 NACに対して複数NVOが絡むようなCase）の追加

を彼らがGHQに来る前につぶしておこうということになっています。

ついては、まだProcessは整備中ではあるものの、来週の火曜水曜くらいを目途に最新版をONEJに共有してReviewしてもらうこととしましょう。

どの内容をシェアするかについては、PwCさんも含めた打ち合わせの中で合わせさせていただければと思います。

宜しくお願い致します。

お疲れ様です。

先ほどはお時間いただきありがとうございました。

スライド4について、以下の通りまとめました。

BのGoogle FormはSales-CST間のやり取り用とのことですが、Google Formに2点(1.Due Date for Pricer

2.T\&CなどのRemark Column)追加すると良いと思いましたのでご検討頂けますか？

EのCST-Salesのやり取りをいかに減らせるかがポイントになりそうですね。

②TST ：今まで通り

③④CST ：

A-Google Driveに格納(ExcelでOK) by Sales

B-Google Form(指示書)に基本情報入力&送信 by Sales to CST

C-Term & Condition準備(for Pricer) by Sales

E-Port Pairが不明な場合 fm CST to Sales

F-Pricerに送信 by Sales

G-Pricerから返信後の入力 by Sales

\[image: image.png\]

先ほど聞きそびれましたが、Simplified Templateのドラフトはございますでしょうか？

スライド15のR2以降についても詳細をお伺いしたいので、来週よろしくお願いいたします。

早速ご対応いただき有難う御座います。内容拝見させていただきます。

すみません。一点お伺いし忘れておりましたので、お手数ですが確認させていただきたく。

水曜午前の打ち合わせの通り、当面は以下2/3月リリースとなる可能性のあるTender Sheetについて、Conversion

Studyをしていきますが、Tender Dashoard（Tender

Logを管理するList）作成の観点で、同一荷主でも複数のTenderとなる場合、ImportかExportかNVO経由なのか、もしくはTP/Non

TPで違うのか等、以前ご教示いただいた点も識別した上でListに載せられればと思っております。

\[image: image.png\]

つきましては、以下のような重複している荷主について、何のCategoryにおけるTenderなのか、それぞれ情報を追加いただいてもよろしいでしょうか。

BCO/NACでシンプルに判断出来るCaseもあれば、NVOで2行あるCaseもあり、、お手数ですがご確認いただけますと幸いです。

\[image: image.png\]

以上、宜しくお願い致します。

こちらの宿題となっていた以下の2点についてUpdateさせていただきます。

ご確認の程宜しくお願い致します。

   \- \*Simplified Format Template\*

   こちらが現状考えているSimplified Templateとなります。

   メールで問い合わせが来た際に、既存Contractの情報をContract Moduleから抽出するCaseも考えられるため、

   貼り付けしやすいように、フォーマット自体はOPUSからDownloadしたものと似ておりますが、

   Pricingに必要となるキー情報とSurcharge Structure/Tender

   volume等の補足情報をCoverした形となっております。

   いただいたメールのサンプルを参照して例示として入力しておりますが、もし他にも必要なる項目があればご教示いただけますと幸いです。

   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oN1ZyxXMexbvODjwAyXhAyx69f-U2zYng8Q9OTLBXOI/edit\#gid=1349108231

   \- \*Account List/Dashboard\*

   ここからもう少しフォーマットは変わるかもしれませんが、最終化したEagle-XのAccount Listについて、こちらのLinkのような形で

   Round/Event毎の進捗状況を追えるようにしたいと思っております。AV列以降で各Event毎のTimestampもある程度自動で取得出来るような形を考えております。

   複数Tradeが跨る場合に、各Tradeの作業状況も追える仕掛けも別途用意しようと思いますので、準備出来次第ご連絡致します。

バラバラとすみません。

昨日UpdateいただいたCategoryも勘案して、最終的な対象Account Listを纏めておりますが、

NACについて、2月以降の対象を見る限り、1 NACに対して複数NVOが存在するCaseは無さそうですので、

23年度Bidについては、別途お話しさせていただいたようなNVO ConflictのProcessは出てこないということになるでしょうか？

為念最新のListをご確認いただきたく、宜しくお願い致します。

添付\[Overall\]シートに内容を纏めております。

主要なNAC(Hitachi建機やKomatsu等)はだいたい2月前にtenderが始まるようですが、tender

release情報は各営業のインプットを元にしており、各NVOの問い合わせタイミングも違うので２月以降も該当無しとはならないと思います。リストの中であれば、以下４NACは２月以降のpricingとなる可能性が十分にあるので可能な限り事前にconversionを行っておきたいです。ただ、２月以降のtenderが対象となったことで大体の大所は対象外となりそうですね。

\[image: image.png\]

Simplified format/Dashboard はもう少し詳しく確認してみます。

失礼致しました。1月以前に来るものをチェック仕切れておりませんでした。

これらについてはNVO ConflictのProcessの対象になり得るとのこと、承知致しました。

IMASEN/ISEKIについて、こちらの2社はBCOとNACでそれぞれ登録がありましたが、

こういったCaseは別々に交渉をすることになり、事前にコンソリをする必要はないということになるでしょうか？

また年明けにご確認いただけますと幸いです。

今日まで仕事してますので大丈夫です。。。

Imasen/IsekiのようにBCOが重なる場合はBCO担当がbiz ownerとなるのが基本です。

ですので、Imasen/Iseki担当者がpricingを行い、それにNVO担当者もフォロー、と言うのが通常の流れです。

皆さんも良いお年をお迎えください！

明けましておめでとうございます。

本年もどうぞ宜しくお願いします。

早速リマインドとなり恐縮ですが、各項目についてアップデートお待ちしています。

我々から営業へは16日(月)に説明会を行います。これまではEagle

Xのコンセプトと全体の流れの説明がメインでしたが、16日はいよいよPricing(Conversion)に的を絞って営業が具体的に何をしないとならないのか、説明します。各ツールにおいてfinalizeされたものが必要になりますので、来週早いタイミングでご連絡頂ければ幸いです。

\*1. Candidate account finalization\*

a)To be decided upon Conversion study (“Workable” tender should be primary)

b) Feb tender is top priority, Mar tender to be parallelly reviewed

c) Prepare the simplified format case

\- 入力必須をハイライトするなりして明確にする

\- Term Cargo Type Transmode 等決まった項目であるところはPulldownメニューを設定

\- AからGの項目はConversionを依頼するGシートに入力されますが、これらもSimplified Formatに必要でしょうか。

\- Freetimeの欄を追加

\*2. Process finalization\*

a) Prepare check list by G Sheet (Build into Google form)

b) Prepare quick check tool before escalation to Pricer (Trade/Location)

c) Approach for 2nd round onward

d) Provide finalized version

e) Summarize Filing Guideline (Do/Don’ts) and consider how we can use data

in Pricing Tool

\*3. Tender Dashboard preparation\*

a) GHQ to share the mock-up

b) ONEJ to review the contents

多くのタブと情報があります。営業視点では以下項目さえ確認できれば良いので極力シンプルにできますでしょうか。

(荷主名/航路別/ラウンド別にpricing完了したかしていないかのアップデートのみ)

\*4. Rollout to Sales\*

a) ONEJ to conduct rollout to Sales from beg of Jan

16日(月)に向けて来週Japan内で準備を行い、その内容について13日(金)にGHQ皆さんと認識合わせさせてください。

既に近江さんへはカレンダーで招集をお送りしましたが、他の皆さんもご参加必要であれば適宜参加いただければ幸いです。

最後に、これから一緒に作業するCSTメンバーとも事前に顔合わせを行っておきたいと考えています。

可能であれば来週どこかで打ち合わせできれば良いですが(営業へも紹介したい)、皆さんの都合もありますのでそれ以降でも構いません。

１月中に顔合わせの時間をセットアップ頂ければ幸いです。

おはようございます。

火曜日の打ち合わせの通り、一旦本日時点の最新のRollout Mateiralを共有させていただきます。

MaterialのPackageは以下の3部構成で纏めております。

   1\. Outline of Eagle

   2\. Process

   3\. Demo

1については、先月のSingaporeセッションの最初にも説明させていただいた内容と同じものです。

2と3についてですが、2のPrcossの部分でハイレベルのProcess

Flowを簡単に説明した後に、3のDemoを通して詳細を補足説明するという流れになります。

先週までにフィードバックいただいている部分についても、出来る限り各Toolに落とし込んでおりますが、詳細についてはまた明日午後の打ち合わせにてご説明させていただければと思います。

一度目を通していただいて、修正が必要な部分があれば明日の打ち合わせの中で合わせられればと思います。

ご確認宜しくお願い致します。

ご連絡ありがとうございました。

事前に頂けて大変助かります。早速佐久間さんともいくつか確認対応頂いてありがとうございました。

明日はよろしくお願いします。

一つ火曜日の打ち合わせで預かっていた点ですが、2月以降はたしてどの程度のSimplified Format（20lane以上且つcustomer

formatであるもの\*以外\*)が見込まれるのか、について営業から集めた同じBID集計の数字を見てみました。結果は下記の通りです。

BCO/NVOと同じNACのテンダーが重なるものも一部あると思いますが、ざっと２月以降は214件を想定しています(営業インプットを元にして)。

時期的にもNVOが多くなりますが、後は２月より早く入るものもあれば、これ以外に追加で入るものも多くあるはずですので、あくまでも参考の数字として使って頂ければと思います。

今日はありがとうございました。

月曜日に向けて準備します。

ひとつ、近江さんとチャットした件ですが、候補として名前が挙がっていない荷主・BIDが入った場合は都度Japan SYM経由でGHQ

SYMへ連絡・確認とする事にしました。

(近江さんとのチャット、Japan内での打ち合わせでは全てConvertしない方向としていましたが。。。)

高橋さんと相談し、数も限られるはずで今年Convertしておくべきなのでそのように対応します。

今日Japan内での打ち合わせでまた幾つか確認事項が出てきました。急ぐ内容ではないのでまた来週取り纏めて相談させて頂きます。

良い週末を！

本日予定通り営業への説明会を行いました。

我々説明する側も上手く纏めるのに非常に苦労したのですが、営業の反応を伺う限り、何かやらないといけない事は分かった、と言った程度であったと思います。

(Q＆Aでも質問は２，３個しか出てこず)

2,3回と説明を聞いて、実際にhands onで作業してみればより詳しく分かる事を伝えています。

これから営業へは情報と資料に加えて、質問を纏めるシートを共有し、極力本番までに営業の皆さんが準備できているように誘導していきます。

営業の質問はこれから受けますが、取り急ぎ我々の中で確認したい点についてご連絡します。

お手数ですが、ご確認ください。

\- それぞれツールのfinal ver. (or いつリリースされるのか)

\- それぞれのフォルダーリンク

\- Conversionが不可となった荷主リスト(先日の打ちあわせでは3月の荷主までカバーして、１月第２週目までに完了すると)

\-  Conversion上、特別ルート指定の場合は「T\&C」へその旨明記で良い？それともPricingのメールにベタ打ちで説明？？

\-

ノミネート荷主のRFAですが、ノミネートした49社についてはDashboard上で既にGHQでRFA/SC番号の候補を入れて頂いていると理解しています。

そこにsimplified formatで連絡した200+社のものも入れて、共有頂くことは可能でしょうか。

それをもって、営業へはRFA/SC番号の確認を行うよう依頼します。

以下ご共有いただき有難う御座います。

先週の打ち合わせで話をしていた点の改修も含め、Conversion Tool/Google

Formに反映していることもあり、取り急ぎ本日時点での最新版の共有となりますが、以下ご確認いただきたく、宜しくお願い致します。

\- それぞれツールのfinal ver. (or いつリリースされるのか)

各ツールの最新版をリンクと合わせて共有させていただきます。

1)/2)についてはもう少しUpdateがあるかもしれませんが、1月末には最終版がお送り出来るかと思います。

\*1) Google Form/Check List\*

\*a. Google Form:\*

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdNFKkpBYVsYIMs87FRT2Je4MzfXKBeGYEx3pKP-omhtPO6Ew/viewform

\*Google Formについて、SC/RFA NoはAccount

Listに記載されている内容を引っ張ってくる仕様にしておりますので、入力項目を若干減らすようにしております

\*b. Check List:\*

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kvN36-uA8d4KBlxM-l-ksAvgelILNwwmBc-LD92U5x4/edit\#gid=279806227

\*c. Simplified Format\*

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oN1ZyxXMexbvODjwAyXhAyx69f-U2zYng8Q9OTLBXOI/edit\#gid=1270162646

Formatは先週金曜のものから大きく変更ありませんが、G Sheetで入力いただく形になります。

Simplified formatの場合、Check Listの入力内容も少なくなりますので、同じG

Sheetのファイル内別タブに必要あれば入力してもらう形として、1つのG Sheetの入力で完結する形としております。

\*2) Tender Account List/Dashboard\*

JPN用にシートを用意しておりますので、実際の運用ではこちらをご確認いただくイメージです。

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16jjttttAF1OauhItn-Z1PWxnvukBNUy4fmjL5Ncuw6U/edit\#gid=1305019878

\*3) Location/Trade Mapping Check Tool\*

こちらは先週時点から基本的にUpdateはありません。

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xRCfOoi5Cnr1ajsNNwpZHZtRgpEdVbFB\_Ds8NF0B9fY/edit\#gid=0

\- それぞれのフォルダーリンク

\- Conversionが不可となった荷主リスト(先日の打ちあわせでは3月の荷主までカバーして、１月第２週目までに完了すると)

2月の対象Accountについてはほぼ作業が完了しておりまして、一部Account（住友化学等）を除いては基本的にWorkableというステータスです。

ただ、Customer Sheetの複雑さによっては後工程（コンソリやSalesでのコピペ）が大変になることもあり、その部分のE2E

Processも含めてReviewをしておりますので、Reviewが完了次第、Account毎のStatusをUpdateさせていただきます。

3月の対象Accountについては2月1週目くらいにはConversion

Studyを終えるように、足元Eagle-Xチーム/CSTで作業を進めています。

\-  Conversion上、特別ルート指定の場合は「T\&C」へその旨明記で良い？それともPricingのメールにベタ打ちで説明？？

こちらは、Customer SheetにそのようなRequestが入っている場合はRemarkとしてMappingしてPricing

Toolに渡すことになりますが、

Customer SheetにRequestが入っていない場合はSalesからPricerに出していただくメールに記載していただくことになります。

\-

ノミネート荷主のRFAですが、ノミネートした49社についてはDashboard上で既にGHQでRFA/SC番号の候補を入れて頂いていると理解しています。

そこにsimplified formatで連絡した200+社のものも入れて、共有頂くことは可能でしょうか。

それをもって、営業へはRFA/SC番号の確認を行うよう依頼します。

近江さん

本日予定通り営業への説明会を行いました。

我々説明する側も上手く纏めるのに非常に苦労したのですが、営業の反応を伺う限り、何かやらないといけない事は分かった、と言った程度であったと思います。

(Q＆Aでも質問は２，３個しか出てこず)

2,3回と説明を聞いて、実際にhands onで作業してみればより詳しく分かる事を伝えています。

これから営業へは情報と資料に加えて、質問を纏めるシートを共有し、極力本番までに営業の皆さんが準備できているように誘導していきます。

営業の質問はこれから受けますが、取り急ぎ我々の中で確認したい点についてご連絡します。

お手数ですが、ご確認ください。

\- それぞれツールのfinal ver. (or いつリリースされるのか)

\- それぞれのフォルダーリンク

\- Conversionが不可となった荷主リスト(先日の打ちあわせでは3月の荷主までカバーして、１月第２週目までに完了すると)

\-  Conversion上、特別ルート指定の場合は「T\&C」へその旨明記で良い？それともPricingのメールにベタ打ちで説明？？

\-

ノミネート荷主のRFAですが、ノミネートした49社についてはDashboard上で既にGHQでRFA/SC番号の候補を入れて頂いていると理解しています。

そこにsimplified formatで連絡した200+社のものも入れて、共有頂くことは可能でしょうか。

それをもって、営業へはRFA/SC番号の確認を行うよう依頼します。

Simplified FormatのAccountについて、Account Listに対象顧客、及び対象となり得るSC/RFA

Noを追加しておりますのでご確認いただきたく、宜しくお願い致します。

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16jjttttAF1OauhItn-Z1PWxnvukBNUy4fmjL5Ncuw6U/edit\#gid=307410802

AE列にSimplified FormatかどうかのFlagをつけており、AA列にSC/RFA Noを記載しております。

SC/RFA Noについては、以下の条件で対象となり得るものを纏めております。

・BCO：SC/RFA Customerに該当するSC/RFA No

・NVO：NVOのSC/RFA Noのうち、該当するActual Customer Codeが含まれているもの

NVOのContractで、NAC単位でFilingされていない可能性もあり、その場合対象SC/RFA

Noが取れていないのですが、大本のNVOのSC/RFA Noを参照すべきかどうか、合わせてご確認いただけますと幸いです。

宜しくお願い致します。

内容確認、整理の上営業へ確認します。

ちなみにSimplified Formatを利用するNVOにおいては、ここで事前にノミネートされている荷主の中でも担当がBiz

Ownerでない場合が考えられます。その場合はBiz

OwnerからPricingを行って頂くので、通常通り実績やRFA・SC番号はプライサーへ連絡・説明いただくようリマインドします。

既にBiz Ownerでないと分かっているものは何か知りリマークするようにします。

お疲れ様です。増田です。

JPのTender conversion studyの状況について共有させて頂きます。

2月、3月のTenderシートの中でEagle XのプロセスでUnwrokableなものは下記となります。

   \- MITSUI CHEMICALS, INC.（BCO・2月）

   \- ZEON CORPORATION（NAC・3月）

   \- Tsurumi Manufacturing Co Ltd. （NAC・3月）

   \- TENMA CORPORATION （NAC・3月）

上記以外についてはすべてWorkableになります。

※厳密に言うと残り２Tender現在conversion studyがWIPですが、概ねWorkableになりそうなところが見えております。

基本的にUnworkableなTenderは複数のシート（もしくは複数のファイル）でヘッダがバラバラでConversion前のデータマッサージに多くの時間がかかる点が主な理由になります。

技術的にはできる（作業時間を無視すれば）Tenderもあるため、翌年に向けてはさらにWorkableにできないか（Alteryxの活用等）は別途検討したいと考えております。

いったん直近の2月、3月について、上記４Tenderは顧客テンダーシートを使った現在の運用をEagle

X開始後も続けていただけるよう、Salesにご説明いただけると幸いです。

よろしくお願い致します。

先ほどはありがとうございました。

まだ全て揃ってはいませんが、Simplified Format Sample\_JP

\<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wQEA3gEgRT1vfdIm6niMLabskvq2c61g\>

 フォルダにSampleを格納しておりますのでご確認ください。

☆：To be Customer Formatと思われるFormat

★：Simplified Format Sample格納済

★★：Simplified Formatに入力済

会議でもご相談したRINNAIのOTHER

\<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16oTWPKPbQRl405Du2Rab\_9u5MQryigKn\>

について、以下返答がありました。

Q.

各SURCHARGE名は、PRICERから返事がINCL YAS,FAF。と来てから項目欄に入力しているのか？

それとも、事前にPRICERに返してほしい各SURCHARGE名を項目欄に入力した上で見積もり依頼しているのか？

A.

まずプライサーから【USD\*\*\* INC YAS

only】みたいに返事をもらってから、自分で課徴SURCHARGEを入れています。その際に参考にしているのはPricing Simulationです。

Simplified Formatに入力してみた結果、

・18レーンであっても、Simplified Formatに転記するのは手間 \> 戻ってきてから荷主Formatに転記し直すのも手間

・SURCHARGEは可能な限り返してくれると便利

と感じたので、「Customer Formatは可能な限り使用し、Conversionする！」と良さそうですね。

Conversion可能なCustomer Formatか、ご確認よろしくお願いいたします。

そしてConversionが可能なのであれば、営業への指示としては、

「考えうるSURCHARGE項目を事前にCustomer Formatに入力してください！」とお願いすれば良さそうですね。

他の案件は順次Simplified Formatに入力していきますので、よろしくお願いいたします。

仰る通り、Caseに応じてFlexibleな対応をした方が良いかと思いますので、このような事例が出てきた場合は都度ご共有いただけますと幸いです。

我々の方でも検証をして、必要に応じて凡例集としてSOPに落とし込みたいと思います。

先程の打ち合わせの通り、Unworkableを除いたWorkable caseの中で、

RHQ

Pricer管轄のLaneが入っているもの、またPricerからのUpdateで今日時点で既にBidが始まってしまっているものについて纏めておりますので添付ご査収ください。

また来週水曜午後に、ツールを活用した一連のFlow/Communicationについて、Pricerも交えて確認出来ればと思いますので、別途Invitationお送り致します。

すみません。最後の最後検証中だった2つのTenderのうち1つが、事前に多くのデータ操作が必要になりそうなことがわかり、

直近ではUnwrokableとさせていただけないでしょうか。

   \- MITSUI CHEMICALS, INC.（BCO・2月）

   \- ZEON CORPORATION（NAC・3月）

   \- Tsurumi Manufacturing Co Ltd. （NAC・3月）

   \- TENMA CORPORATION （NAC・3月）

   \- HITACHI INSTITUTION MACHINERY（NAC・3月）

これですべて検証は完了しておりますので、上記以外はすべてWorkableになります。

（近江さんから説明がありましたが、JP

Pricerを超えてMultipleなトレードの対象は上記以外も対象外にはなりますが、ツール的にはWorkableになります。）

よろしくお願い致します。

催促ばかりで恐縮ですが、ツールのご連絡を今日お待ちしています。

もうひとつ、今日Japan内で打ち合わせをしていた中で、2nd round以降の流れについて各自認識・理解が違う事が分かりました。

今一度、以下確認させてください。

\*2nd Round以降\*

1st RoundでMRG等を利用するため、トレードの個別のプライシングが必要が無い場合は、2nd RoundからPricing

Toolを利用する(= Conversion作業する)

1st RoundからConversionを行い、2nd Round用にフレッシュな荷主フォーマットがある場合は新たにPricing

Toolを利用する(= Conversion作業する)

⇒

この場合、レーン数が少ない場合はConversionをかけるよりメールのやり取りのみで対応したい(営業自身が荷主フォーマットへ手入力する)という営業も出てくると思います。必ずConversionを掛けないといけない、という事ではないですよね？

⇒ 極力営業へ2つのオプションを渡したいです(再度Conversionかける or メールでやり取り を営業で判断)

1st RoundからPricing Toolを使う場合、2nd Round以降はメールのやり取りでOKという場合

⇒ この場合、Pricerは実際には1st Roundで利用したPricing

Toolを使ってPricingをするという理解でよいですか？(Pricer側の対応を把握しておきたく)

⇒ その場合、2nd Roundの運賃を荷主フォーマットへRe-Conversionかけられると営業視点で便利だと考えました。そうでなければ、2nd

RoundオファーはPricerから営業へメールで返答があると理解しています。

深井さん

ツール/SOPについては急ぎUpdateをかけておりますので、明日中にご連絡させていただきます。

お待たせしてしまい申し訳ございませんが少々お時間いただきたく。

2dn Round以降について、前回のCallでの我々の説明が不十分だったかもしれません。クリアにご説明出来ておらず失礼しました。

以下青字でコメント追記させていただきます。

\*2nd Round以降\*

1st RoundでMRG等を利用するため、トレードの個別のプライシングが必要が無い場合は、2nd RoundからPricing

Toolを利用する(= Conversion作業する)

こちらはSimplified FormatのCaseの時を想定しており、Customer FormatのCaseは基本的に1st

RoundからのCoversionを想定しております。

SimplifiedのようなLane数が少ない場合は、PricerがSalesに展開している若干高めのGuideline

Rateで初手を打って、荷主からフィードバックがあった段階でSales/PricerとのCommunicationが始まるCaseがあるのとのことでしたので、Conversion

Tool/Pricing Toolも1st Roundのデータがなくても、2nd Roundからツールが動かせるような仕掛けにしております。

1st RoundからConversionを行い、2nd Round用にフレッシュな荷主フォーマットがある場合は新たにPricing

Toolを利用する(= Conversion作業する)

⇒

この場合、レーン数が少ない場合はConversionをかけるよりメールのやり取りのみで対応したい(営業自身が荷主フォーマットへ手入力する)という営業も出てくると思います。必ずConversionを掛けないといけない、という事ではないですよね？

2nd Round用にフレッシュな荷主フォーマットが来る場合においては極力Conversionもするというのが基本Processになりますが、

（G FormのInputやConversionのデータを取り込まないとStatus Listにきちんと進捗状況が反映されないため）

そうは言っても時間的にタイトな場合や、Lane数が少ない場合はメールでのやり取りにならざるを得ないかと思いますので、その対応も可とすることで良いかと思います。

⇒ 極力営業へ2つのオプションを渡したいです(再度Conversionかける or メールでやり取り を営業で判断)

上記の通りです。

1st RoundからPricing Toolを使う場合、2nd Round以降はメールのやり取りでOKという場合

⇒ この場合、Pricerは実際には1st Roundで利用したPricing

Toolを使ってPricingをするという理解でよいですか？(Pricer側の対応を把握しておきたく)

⇒ その場合、2nd Roundの運賃を荷主フォーマットへRe-Conversionかけられると営業視点で便利だと考えました。そうでなければ、2nd

RoundオファーはPricerから営業へメールで返答があると理解しています。

Pricing Toolが各テンダーの作業ファイルになりますので、2nd RoundのConversionをかけない場合においても、Pricing

Toolを通してUpdateして行く形になります。

この場合R1のPricing Toolを使う形にはなりますが、掃き出し先のRoundをPricing

Tool上で変更することで、R2のSubmissionフォルダーにファイルを作成出来るようにしておりますので、深井さんの想定されているような対応は可能です。

その場合でも、R2用にコンソリをかけるか（SalesからCSTに依頼してもらえればすぐに対応可能です）、

各Tradeの提出ファイルを直接見に行っていただくか、いずれの対応も可能になります。

薮田さん

ご対応有難う御座います。

内容拝見させていただき、Eagle-Xのマスタデータにも反映するように致します。

2nd Roundについて追加で教えてください。

2nd Round用にフレッシュな荷主フォーマットが来る場合においては極力Conversionもするというのが基本Processになります

Checklistの入力・提出は行わなくて良いでしょうか？

つまり、R2でCustomer Formatがある場合は、以下の流れになりますか？

①Customer FormatをR2のフォルダに格納する

②Initial Check-inを行う

Conversion Checklistの入力・提出は不要

③Reviewは必要

④Send to Pricerも必要

Check listとReviewはR1で既に実施しているので省略して、①と④のStepのみ行っていただくイメージです。

①Customer FormatをR2のフォルダに格納する

②Initial Check-inを行う

Conversion Checklistの入力・提出は不要

③Reviewは基本的には不要（新規Laneが追加された場合には確認が必要となりますが件数としてはあまり多くないのかなと思っております）

④Send to Pricerも必要

各ツールのリンクをありがとうございました。

いよいよ本日よりEagle X始動ですが、どの荷主がスタートしたか確認する方法は以下で合ってますか？(SOPも確認しました)

Dashboard：Customer Listシートの”Initial Check-in

Submitted”がKEYになっていて、Progress欄が"Not Stated"から"In Progress"に変わっているか否か。

一方、"Simplified Format was Created"はKEYになっていませんか？

つまり、Simplified Formatの場合は”Initial Check-in

Submitted”されるまでスタートしたか分からない。ということになりますか？

お疲れ様です。増田です。

１点ご相談がありまして、今後のR2を見越して、事前にR2のConversion studyをEagle

X、及びCSTチームで実施したいと考えております。

もし可能でしたらR2のサンプル（メールやTenderファイル等）をいくつかいただくことは可能でしょうか。

この２,３月でJPで実施するTargetのTenderでR2のサンプルがあればよりありがたいです。

また、明日の定例で補足させていただければと思います。

別途チャットでお話しさせていただいた件です。

昨晩TP Tradeの方から個別にお願いがありまして、Doorを含むBidについてはEagle-Xの対象から外してもらいたいとのことでした。

背景としては以下の通りです。

・今の組織体制として、GHQ JPN

MKTG/OMMCもギリギリの人数で回していて、ただでさえ手間のかかるDoorについて、新プロセスを適用するとかえって時間がかかってしまう。

・Eagle-Xに関わらず、今年は運賃交渉が厳しく、営業からの問い合わせが劇的に増えて来ている中（今後1か月はもっと増えて来る）、追加の負荷がかかってしまうとチームとしても回らなくなってしまう。

・またPricing

Toolで出て来る候補のルートも、PRISMのP1-P3を全てのルートをとってきているということもあり、結構なゴミデータも混ざっており、仮にそれらルートがアサインされて営業に返ってしまった際に不要なやり取りも発生している。

・DoorのケースはCustomer

Specificのルートをアサインすることも多く、この辺りは単にP1-P3のルートというよりは、前年の作業ファイルから判断するため、Pricing

Toolには反映されていない部分も多い。

我々としても、忙しい時期に皆さんにTrialをお願いしている中、新Processの導入によって皆さんに追加の負荷をかけてしまうのは本望ではないので、

ひとまずTP Tradeは比較的対応しやすいCYの部分にFocusするということで進められればと思います。

ですので、\*対象LaneにTPが含まれていて、DoorのBizを含む場合はAs

is processで進める\*、ということでONE JPN内でもUpdateいただきたく、ご対応の程宜しくお願い致します。 Multi

Tradeの場合、ハンドルが難しいかなとも思いましたが、

別電の通り、今までもTPと他のTradeのMixはこれまでやったBidでもあまり多くないこともあり、（SCとRFAで別々で問い合わせが来ることが多い）

ひとまずはこの方針にて進めることとしたく、宜しくお願い致します。

## Message from CEO \- 1st Nov 2022

受信: Tue Nov 01 2022 15:00:00 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Jeremy Nixon \<jeremy.nixon@one-line.com\>  
Dear Magentians,

Following the remarkable performance for FY2021, ONE has continued to

achieve outstanding results for the first half of FY2022.

Financial results for the first half of FY2022 have exceeded that of FY2021

for the same period, and we are currently on track to strong earnings

results for FY2022 based on the latest full financial year forecast.

The management recognises that this success is due to the strong commitment

and hard work of employees; it is not easy to sustain such financial

performance without everyone's contribution.

In view of these achievements, on behalf of all senior management in ONE

group, I am pleased to declare Special Bonus for FY2022 as a form of

recognition and appreciation for your great efforts in supporting the

growth and success of the company.

Quantum and Pay-out Schedule:

Part 1: 1 month of base pay to be paid by the end of December 2022 to all

eligible employees (\*)

Part 2: The actual quantum (if any) is to be determined after FY2022

full-year results are known and to be announced separately. It will be paid

based on each country’s schedule.

\*Eligibility:

   \- All locally hired employees who are confirmed (i.e. complete

   probation) by the end of the preceding month of the pay-out month and are

   on the payroll at the point of payment

   \- Not eligible for temporary staff and expatriates from 3J

   \- Not eligible for employees who have resigned or are dismissed from

   employment before or during the pay-out month

   \- Other local rules applicable. Please refer to your local HR’s guidance.

With the heightened uncertainty in the overall business environment and the

expected gradual normalization in freight rates, we will face more

challenges in the coming years.

However, I hope that we can continue to deliver higher quality and more

competitive services and strive to strengthen our performance as ONE.

Thank you again for your great efforts thus far.

AS ONE, WE CAN.

Dear All,

With reference to Jeremy's message, please be advised of the following:

\- Special Bonus (Part 1\) will be paid to eligible employees on 15 December

2022, together with monthly salary for December 2022 and Annual Wage

Supplement(AWS).

\- As for our local rules applicable in GHQ, this payment will also not be

eligible for employees who have tendered resignation before or during the

pay-out month (December 2022). Should an employee tender resignation in

December 2022 after receiving this Special Bonus payment, the payment will

be duly recovered from the employee.

Thank you.

Best Regards,

GHR Rewards Team

## Alteryx \<\> ONE Meeting  \[17 Oct\] \- Follow up

受信: Tue Oct 18 2022 09:20:22 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Jeanie Poh \<jeanie.poh@alteryx.com\>  
Hi Masuda-san and Jbulls,

Thank you for your time yesterday.

I've summarized our understanding of ONE's requirements for Alteryx relating to the TITAN X Alteryx Project, please feel free to add on or correct me.

Titan Project Objectives

Titan is the Tender Management System onboarded to ONE automate the business process from the receipt of Quotation and Tender documentations from ONE Customers to providing corresponding pricing through TIGER APIs back to customers for Tender Bid responses.

There are 2 main data processes:

  1\.   Titan extracts information from Customer Tender Excel documents into Titan mapping pricing from TIGER

  2\.  Once Pricing is mapped reconversion of the information back into Tender document for submission

Current Challenges

Titan currently only supports up to 40% of Tender formats from customers due to various unstructured/ unsupported tender formats \- "Titan Unworkable"

Of the 800 Tender Documents format, Titan workable is about 150\.

Too many unstructured formats make it hard to justify for custom development/ code solution given tender document/ quotation formats varies too much and could change across time.

Also each Tender Document could have multiple Unworkable reason.

Currently, Tender support team and pricing team have to manually reference information in "Titan unworkable formats" to submit bids, in addition due to the complexity of dynamic formula, bids are sometimes rejected due to incomplete data.

Vision of Solution / Use Case

Alteryx is positioned to potential solve for:

  1\.  The automation of data prep from conversion non-workable Tender Document to "Titan-readable" format;

  2\.  Data Validation automation ensuring that the "reconversion" from Titan back into Tender Document is completed by Pricing and Tender Support Team

Impact of Solution

  1\.  Deduction of Manual Efforts \- time savings and productivity increase

  2\.  Ensuring that Sales team are able to respond to Tender Bid on time \- reducing rejection of tender submission due to lacking information in submission

  3\.  Increasing Effectiveness of Titan and TIGER Pricing Systems

How Alteryx can help?

  1\.   Flexibility of Alteryx (the extent at which) Alteryx are able to help unworkable reasons

  2\.  Self-Service \- enabling ETL Conversion team to learn and solve for changing business process and various use cases

  3\.  Time-to-implementation \- providing much faster implementation of solutions compared to hard-coding ETL

Measuring Success of Alteryx

 % increase of Titan Coverage through Alteryx

@kazuki.masuda\<mailto:kazuki.masuda@one-line.com\> \- do you have benchmark in mind to help us confirm if the trial is successful?

Users of Alteryx

 ONE is building a ETL Conversion team who will use Alteryx Designers.  Consumers of output would be Titan Project team,  Tender Support team, Pricing team

Timeline

 ONE is aiming to decide if Alteryx is the right solution by End of Oct.

@kazuki.masuda\<mailto:kazuki.masuda@one-line.com\> \- is there a reason for this deadline?

Mutual Action Plan

  1\.  Masuda-san and William will send through a summary of Unworkable reasons and reference data structure by Mid-week (Wed/Thurs)

  2\.  Tiffany to review and respond as soon as possible, aiming by this week

  3\.  Review of use cases to find Quick Wins to scope Trial Use Case

  4\.  To run Alteryx training for users customized based on use cases

  5\.  14 Day Alteryx Trial for users \[Could we have some suggested timings for this?\]

  6\.  Approvals on Alteryx by ONE

  7\.  Procurement of Licenses

Other Information required:

  \*   Could you advice us on the approval process for procurement of software licenses?

  \*   How many users will be trialing Alteryx and attending training?

\*\*in blue are some of the questions I have about the evaluation, could you provide this information?

We look forward to the summary of unworkable reasons from ONE and will advise accordingly. As we are working on tight deadlines, given we only have 3 weeks left in October, could we pencil in time to have a discussion next Tuesday?

Hi Masuda-san,

To help us with resource-planning, could you give us an understanding of when the TITAN Project team can share the summary of Unworkable reasons and reference data structure?

I'm on leave next week so I'll need to ensure that we can support your evaluation and keep to the Oct timeline.

Subject: Alteryx \<\> ONE Meeting \[17 Oct\] \- Follow up

Hi Masuda-san and Jbulls,

Thank you for your time yesterday.

I've summarized our understanding of ONE's requirements for Alteryx relating to the TITAN X Alteryx Project, please feel free to add on or correct me.

Titan Project Objectives

Titan is the Tender Management System onboarded to ONE automate the business process from the receipt of Quotation and Tender documentations from ONE Customers to providing corresponding pricing through TIGER APIs back to customers for Tender Bid responses.

There are 2 main data processes:

  1\.   Titan extracts information from Customer Tender Excel documents into Titan mapping pricing from TIGER

  2\.  Once Pricing is mapped reconversion of the information back into Tender document for submission

Current Challenges

Titan currently only supports up to 40% of Tender formats from customers due to various unstructured/ unsupported tender formats \- "Titan Unworkable"

Of the 800 Tender Documents format, Titan workable is about 150\.

Too many unstructured formats make it hard to justify for custom development/ code solution given tender document/ quotation formats varies too much and could change across time.

Also each Tender Document could have multiple Unworkable reason.

Currently, Tender support team and pricing team have to manually reference information in "Titan unworkable formats" to submit bids, in addition due to the complexity of dynamic formula, bids are sometimes rejected due to incomplete data.

Vision of Solution / Use Case

Alteryx is positioned to potential solve for:

  1\.  The automation of data prep from conversion non-workable Tender Document to "Titan-readable" format;

  2\.  Data Validation automation ensuring that the "reconversion" from Titan back into Tender Document is completed by Pricing and Tender Support Team

Impact of Solution

  1\.  Deduction of Manual Efforts \- time savings and productivity increase

  2\.  Ensuring that Sales team are able to respond to Tender Bid on time \- reducing rejection of tender submission due to lacking information in submission

  3\.  Increasing Effectiveness of Titan and TIGER Pricing Systems

How Alteryx can help?

  1\.   Flexibility of Alteryx (the extent at which) Alteryx are able to help unworkable reasons

  2\.  Self-Service \- enabling ETL Conversion team to learn and solve for changing business process and various use cases

  3\.  Time-to-implementation \- providing much faster implementation of solutions compared to hard-coding ETL

Measuring Success of Alteryx

 % increase of Titan Coverage through Alteryx

@kazuki.masuda\<mailto:kazuki.masuda@one-line.com\> \- do you have benchmark in mind to help us confirm if the trial is successful?

Users of Alteryx

 ONE is building a ETL Conversion team who will use Alteryx Designers.  Consumers of output would be Titan Project team,  Tender Support team, Pricing team

Timeline

 ONE is aiming to decide if Alteryx is the right solution by End of Oct.

@kazuki.masuda\<mailto:kazuki.masuda@one-line.com\> \- is there a reason for this deadline?

Mutual Action Plan

  1\.  Masuda-san and William will send through a summary of Unworkable reasons and reference data structure by Mid-week (Wed/Thurs)

  2\.  Tiffany to review and respond as soon as possible, aiming by this week

  3\.  Review of use cases to find Quick Wins to scope Trial Use Case

  4\.  To run Alteryx training for users customized based on use cases

  5\.  14 Day Alteryx Trial for users \[Could we have some suggested timings for this?\]

  6\.  Approvals on Alteryx by ONE

  7\.  Procurement of Licenses

Other Information required:

  \*   Could you advice us on the approval process for procurement of software licenses?

  \*   How many users will be trialing Alteryx and attending training?

\*\*in blue are some of the questions I have about the evaluation, could you provide this information?

We look forward to the summary of unworkable reasons from ONE and will advise accordingly. As we are working on tight deadlines, given we only have 3 weeks left in October, could we pencil in time to have a discussion next Tuesday?

Hi Masuda-san,

Thank you for this document, could we set up time to get some clarifications on the unworkable reasons, esp on what you've mentioned around specific examples of each case(Ex. Horizontal Format Issue, Location Grouping,Data Validation Dynamic Formula).

Tiffany has some intial feedback where Alteryx is applicable but we need some context around some points like

  \*   Location Grouping

  \*   And how the data is structured for Data Validation and Dynamic Formula, etc

Will the team be available for Thurs, 3 Nov \- 10am to 11am? Alternatively, please let us know your schedule for Friday, 4 Nov?

As we have missed the evaluation deadline for October, can you share context around the new deadline and impact of an delays to help us resource for this evaluation?

## Eagle X Task Force 設定の件

受信: Sun Oct 16 2022 22:22:25 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Kenichi Michida \<kenichi.michida@one-line.com\>  
プロジェクト担当各位、

今週以降、Eagle

Xのプロセスに沿って、実際のデータを活用しながら、検証作業及び最終的には個別の顧客フォーマット毎にE2Eのプロセスを設定する（Mappingも含めて）事となりますが、今後関係者も含めて多層的になっていくことから、全体像及び、夫々の作業の目的（目標）をクリアにしていく必要があるかと思います。

取り急ぎ、添付の通り全体をEagle X Task Forceという形で定義づけ、夫々のステップで目的及び目標を設定していくことになるかと思います。

先ずは、GHQ及びTITANプロジェクトチームで組成する、Support

Teamのメンバーの確定及び、今後のタスクに就いて決めていく必要があるかと思います。明日以降の打ち合わせで、順次アップデートしていければ、と思います。

尚、DYM側でのメンバーの勧誘（というか誘拐？）は、明日にでも行う予定ですので、メンバーの組成は早急に完了させます（添付ファイルの各部署からのメンバーも、正式にご確認頂ければ、と思います）。

勿論、ご意見等ありましたら、何なりとお願い申し上げます。

## （重要）Eagle X Roll Out 資料の件

受信: Sun Oct 09 2022 16:15:37 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Kenichi Michida \<kenichi.michida@one-line.com\>  
寺田さん、

先日、少し口頭で申し上げましたが、Eagle X Roll Outに対応する資料のBlush

Upが必要性が増しております。お忙しいところ申し訳ございませんが、皆様のご協力及び、具体的なTO

DOのアクションをお願い申し上げます。可能であれば、来週の欧州でのプレゼンに使えれば、と思います。現時点では、EUAが一番理解度が低い状況と思われますので。

（少し五月雨式に記載しておりまして、読みにくく申し訳ございません）

①、プロセスの流れを、現状とContingeny Plan（後述の通り、Quick

Solutionsでも良いかと）でそれぞれ記載し、誰がどこでどのツールを使って、何をやるのかに特化して、記載。その上で、別途スライドで変更点のみにFocusして記載を行う。End-to-end（Trade

Strategy →

AP作成まで）での記載は必須と思われますが、SOPと全体像の流れの間くらいの粒度感で記載できれば、ぱっとみ何をするのか（或いは何が変わるのか）が判りやすくなるのでは、と理解します。

②、それぞれのプロセスに係わる詳細（SOP若しくは、画面イメージ）に就いては、Appendixで付けていくような形で詳細化を図ればよいかと。

③、以前作って頂いたスライドにこの記載がありますが、OnshhoreやOffshoreの切り口等がないと、Sales側としてもピンと来ないので、パターン化してAS

ISとTO BEを記載するようなイメージが良いかと思います。 TO BEもContingency

PlanとTIGER以降となりますが、前者に比重を掛けるようなイメージで記載できると良いかと。TIGER以降に就いては、何れにせよUnder

Developmentという扱いで結構です。

\[image: image.png\]

④、ポイントは自分の契約がどのスコープに入るかどうかということが、関心事かと思います（というかPricer以外は、これしか興味がない）。切り口は、Eagleの対象かどうか、Tender

Scheduleに入っているかどうか、OnshoreかOffshoreか、TITANを使うかどうか（Gsheet Conversion

Toolを使うかどうか）、Conversion作業をOffshoreに投げるかどうか、2023年4月以降の契約かどうか、AP作成の対象かどうか（CVAの対象になるか）あたりになりますので、少し多重的になりますが、これでどのパターンにハマるかで、プロセスが決まると思量します。

イメージは以下をベースにすることになりますが、最終的にはどのパターンに自分が入るかが判る（リスト化されている一覧ファイルが、どこでもアクセスできる状況）形が必要となるかと。

\[image: image.png\]

⑤、わかりやすさを全面に押し出すには、少し構成をTrade/Marketing向けの資料から変えて、Pain

Pointsからスタートするのも良いかもしれません。Pain Points → Quick Solutions → Permanent

Solutions（この部分は最小限でOK）というのが流れ的には良いかと。Pain

Pointsは、なるべくLocalの人間に親しみのある点を中心に記載するほうが、イメージが湧きやすいかと。マニュアルが多い、二重入力が多い、統一性がない、時間がかかる、プライシングが正しくない、D\&Dの条件が分かりにくい、Surchargeの条件がみえにくい等々。で夫々に、Quick

Solutionsが十分に機能するような見せ方が、納得感を表現できるのではないかと。

⑥、Terminologyの統一に就いては、もう一度要確認かと。たしかにContingency Planではありますが、どちらかというと、Quick

Solutionsの方が前向きかとも思いました。TIGERの開発に失敗したからというよりは、もっと前向きにFelixibleであることを全面に出してRoll

Outした方が良いと思いました。

⑦、⑤に関連しますが、Pain Pointsを具体的に示すようなSampleがあれば、記載した方がより納得感が出るかと思いました。以下がイメージです。

＊TITANの導入状況（4000－5000の長期契約に対して、130程度の実績）by Onshore/Offshore/Region

＊TITANのWorkable/Non

WorkableのAssesment状況（ある程度のManual作業をOnshoreに求めるものは、導入が難しいのでNot Workableで良いかと）

＊TIGERに就いては、FAK及びAd-hocのみの運用となっているが、導入途上且つ対応が複雑なLong Term Contract

Renewalに就いては、大規模な開発とテスト、トレーニングが必要

⑧、今後のRoll Outの予定（Online / F2F）や、Support体制の構築（予定）、Tutorial

Video（可能であれば）を記載の上で、依頼事項を纏める。依頼については、先ずはどこのOnshoreでどの程度の契約があるかを確定させることが先決で、且つそのうち、どの契約をOffshoreでConversionするかを決める必要あり。また、Offshoreに回すものについては、必要情報を纏めて（with

昨年度Template）投げてもらう必要あり。

これらを10ページくらいに纏めて、それ以外の詳細はAppendixに回すようなイメージです。

なので、これをベースにTO DOを決めたいと思いますが、如何でしょうか？

基本は、これまで議論してきた内容の延長線上にありますので、なるべく使いまわしできれば良いですが。其の上でBlush Upしていければ、と思います。

1\) スケルトンの準備 （寺田さん）

2\) 補足情報の収集

TITANに就いては、上述の導入状況及び、Assessmentの情報（増田さん）

TITANのReverse Processの検証（増田さん）

今後のRoll Outの予定（道田でドラフト）

ご参考までに。添付の通り、RHQ

Management会議で使用した資料をご展開申し上げます。まぁ、この内容を網羅する時間はありませんでしたが。。。。ほとんど、Eagle

Xに時間を掛けました。

尚、こちらは、栗本さんから頂戴したメッセージとなります。

正しく、上述の記載した内容と合致しますし、受け取り手の事を考えると、矢張りこの手の資料は必要と考えられますので、既存の資料をBlush

Upして、其の上でできる限り読みてに合わせる形で、作成が必要と考えます。

Pricing Versionに就いては、それ程大きな心配をしておりませんが、矢張りRHQのConcernsはTender

Conversionにありますので、此処を以下に解りやすくするかが鍵かと。

///quote///

９．23年度Tender対応繋ぎツールとTITAN/TIGERの今後

昨日の夜に何人かとサラッと話をしましたが、依然何が起こりつつあるのか良く理解できていないヒトたちが

おられる模様。

・現在のテンダーハンドリングprocedure

・TITAN/TIGERで実現しようとしていたprocedure

・23年度向けの緊急対応で実施しようとしているprocedure

の三つのBusiness Procedureにおいて、

・具体的な作業のどの部分が誰に割り振られることになるのか、

・その前提でRHQ/Countryサイドでどのような準備をしてもらいたいのか、

（例えば、顧客フォーマットからONE FormatへのConversionは各地のC-KAMにお願いすることになる、とか。

今まではSalesは顧客フォーマットをPricerにぶん投げるだけだった（？）のであれば、

確実に追加業務になりますね。 この部分を明確に知りたい、ということかと思います、RHQとしては）

・GHQとしての対応（Training、OMMC活用など含む）として何をやるのか、

を判りやすく説明してあげてください。

そのうえで、TITANについてはどういう方向で再開発を考えているのか、の説明もできるだけ具体的に

（まだまだこれから検討というコトなのかなと思いますが、そのあたりも含めてできるだけオープンに）

## (Request) New function for Customer Format Conversion with Alteryx

受信: Fri Sep 23 2022 16:57:15 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Kenichi Michida \<kenichi.michida@one-line.com\>  
\*Dear Ueki san, Maeda san, Jbuls, Pei Yee, Olaf,\*

As per the separate discussion, we designed the attached process flow for

further expansion of TITAN usage coverage in order to materialize the

Pricing Grand Design under the Yield Management DX Master Plan.

As you can refer to the contents from the materials, we suffered from the

lower usage ratio of TITAN in terms of the template conversion perspective.

The Pricing Grand Design should require the smooth and comprehensive

template conversion to our OPUS code and template which can be connected to

the downstream process like pricing. This conversion process should be one

of the challenges and roadblocks for the Pricing Grand Design.

TITAN can't accommodate the full scope of long term contract renewal

requirements due to the complexity and uniqueness of customer formats.

Hence, our approach is to expand the scope of TITAN coverage cases by

inserting one more step prior to the data upload to TITAN. It should be the

ETL set-up to convert from the customer template to the more suitable

format for TITAN for the purpose of smooth data handling at the downstream

process.

In this connection, I would like to propose the following arrangement for

the migration to the new scheme.

\*1) To implement Alteryx to build up ETL solution based on the each

customer template \*

Assumption : minimum 20 users (TITAN Project Team \= 3-4, WNS New Team as

below \= 5-7, OMMC \= 2-3 and Onshore team 5 or more)

As for the training, we are planning to use the on-line training program

with some subscription fee. But, if you have any good ideas, we are welcome

to get your thoughts

\*2) To establish the new function called "Template Conversion Team

(temporal name)" in WNS Philippine\*

Assumption : 5-7 ETL users to build up the conversion (in and out) scheme

and manual entry people to support for other columns out scope of ETL

bridge. This manual entry people may be required more than ETL members, but

it's subject to some trials with usage of real customer templates.

WNS Philippine should be more suitable than India for the possible

collaboration with OMMC pricing team.

Even though it's a small team, it should be better to establish this new

team to make a dry run of the new planned scheme and structure for quick

and further expansion of scope.

You can refer to the attached presentation materials.

But, just in case, please don't circulate to other teams (e.g. TITAN

project team) due to confidentiality of information in order to avoid

confusion.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me without hesitation.

Best regards,

Mitch

Hi Jublls,

Thank you for your arrangement of the follow up session with Otuka san.

I believe that we could hold a good kick-off session. Although the timeline

is challenging, I would appreciate it if you could accomodate our

requirements to materialize our business goals for the next year contract

renewal under the current adverse market situation.

Hi Pei Yee,

I would like to check the on-going discussion with WNS. Then, we will set

up the session with WNS on how to kick off. Thank you.

Adding Lucas for visibility.

Dear All

I have talked with Alteryx & received license types below.

Alteryx has 2 license models. One is Alteryx Designer for Desktop, the

other is Designer Cloud powered by Trifacta

But Designer Cloud is based on recently merged cloud ETL tool named

"Trifacta" & is not the same as Alteryx Designer, Still 2 products are not

merged yet.

\*\* So If you want "Alteryx Designer", we need to purchase "Alteryx Designer

for Desktop".\*

FYI, we can install "Alteryx Designer for Desktop" on \*GCP VM(Virtual

Machine)\* if we need more computing & memory power.

Also ask them about Alteryx training & they are waiting for the Training

offerings from PWC(Alteryx training partner).

If needed, we could have a meeting to check our use cases & get trial

licenses for our function checkup.

If you have any requirements related to Alteryx, please let me know.

Thanks and Best Regards

Dear Jbulls,

Thank you so much for your arrangement.

We would like to use Alteryx designer, so we would appreciate it if you

would purchase "Alteryx Designer for Desktop".

Also, we are willing to take the Alteryx training from PWC. I can provide

some use cases as well.

Dear Michida-san,

In principle, we support to establish the new "Template Conversion Team" in

WNS Philippines/Manila, to further expand TITAN usage coverage and

materialize the Pricing Grand Design under the YM DX Master Plan.

May we understand/clarify that:

   \- The 5-7 ETL users is a ballpark number for now, and the number of FTEs

   is subject to change based on the trials. May we know what is the basis for

   the 5-7 ETL user (how is 5-7 FTEs calculated)?

   \- The manual entry people to support other columns out of ETL scope is

   excluded from the 5-7 ETL users, and the additional number of FTEs needed

   is also subject to the trials of real customer templates, or calculated

   later?

   \- Some trials or dry-run will be conducted with WNS Manila (by nominated

   PICs) so that WNS can assess the complexity of the task. We would recommend

   a dry-run or a walkthrough of the work so that WNS can better understand

   the process and work scope.

Thank you.

Hi Pei Yee,

Thank you for your feedback. Let me share my reply in this color.

   \- The 5-7 ETL users is a ballpark number for now, and the number of FTEs

   is subject to change based on the trials. May we know what is the basis for

   the 5-7 ETL user (how is 5-7 FTEs calculated)? \=\> Our targets for the

   long term contract will be 4,000-5,000 levels throughout the year. We will

   evaluate how many cases should be handled by the offshore team although we

   are developing the easier conversion function in the Google Sheet. But, a

   certain volume (400-500) will come to the new offshore team to make a

   better conversion. This is a really ballpark number subject to the velocity

   of ETL .

   \- The manual entry people to support other columns out of ETL scope is

   excluded from the 5-7 ETL users, and the additional number of FTEs needed

   is also subject to the trials of real customer templates, or calculated

   later? \=\> Your understanding is correct.

   \- Some trials or dry-run will be conducted with WNS Manila (by nominated

   PICs) so that WNS can assess the complexity of the task. We would recommend

   a dry-run or a walkthrough of the work so that WNS can better understand

   the process and work scope. \=\> Yes. Your understanding is correct.

Please be kindly guided that we are rolling out to each region the new

scheme with the usage of the above structure from next week. In other

words, we need to prepare some support schemes as soon as possible. If we

can't set up in a timely manner, then this scheme will not be materialized.

I would appreciate it if you could speed up the organization setting up. If

you can take much time for ETL resource arrangements, I would recommend

arranging the manual solution team with a few people first for the trial

and dry-run for our evaluation..

Priority 1 : Manual handling resources (a few people) for process

evaluation immediately

Priority 2 : ETL resources (a few people) for process evaluation

Priority 3 : Other resource assignment based on the above trials and

evaluation results

We are planning to have roll out sessions as follows. Hence, if these new

members can join, I would like to ask them to participate .

In Singapore : Key members of OMMC pricers and OMMC Tender Support Team

will join (24th-27th Oct) for the end-to-end process rolling out

In Manila : We will visit OMMC office to have the end-to-end process

sessions on Nov 7 and 8th (subject to change)

Then, we will ask the WNS Manila Offshore team to start the trials with

usage of last year's template for better preparation before the official

tender starts.

Best regards,

Mitch

We are planning to train the Alteryx to get more skills and knowledge to

Hi Jbulls,

Thank you for your intensive support on this matter. Much appreciated.

The installment based on the above cost inquiry should be fine. Please go

ahead.

As for the training structure and contents, I would like to get some

comments and opinions from Masuda san.

Masuda san,

I would appreciate it if you could advise your thoughts on the training

program.

Best regards,

Dear Jbulls,

Regarding the training program, I would like PwC to hold practical training

using Titan unworkable cases as much as possible.

Also, the total number of Titan team and offshore WNS members is likely to

exceed 10, so we would like to adjust that as well. If possible, it would

be better if we can record the training session for future internal use.

Anyway, we have a meeting with Alteryx & PwC this Thursday so let me

discuss this there.

Thank you so much for coordinating it.

I agree with the Alteryx license and training as you suggested.

If the target date is fixed, I will add each member to the invitation.

Also, I will send the sample tender file which includes multiple

## Roll Out Materials (TITAN Project)

受信: Fri Sep 23 2022 15:55:28 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Kenichi Michida \<kenichi.michida@one-line.com\>  
増田さん、

スイマセン。お返事が遅くなりまして申し訳ございません。

頂戴しましたスライドに付記されておりました、ご質問ポイントについて、下記の通りお返事させて頂きます。

P8

\[image: image.png\]

→此処については、記載してもDemotivateするだけだと思いますし、これから検討することですので、長期エンハンスメントの方針は今後検討するということで、如何でしょうか？

P10

\[image: image.png\]

→メインは、4月以降の契約となりますので、できる限りリソースの無駄遣いを避けたいので、先ずは4月以降のものに傾注するということで良いかと思います。

余裕があれば、4月より前のものもETLで業務簡素化を図るべきだと思いますが、そこは正直必須ではないかと思量します。

因みに、4月以降に就いては、NVOも含めて全てが対象となります。

P15

\[image: image.png\]

→昨日（夕方）の議論の結果を確認できておりませんが、現時点では①TITAN、②TITAN固定フォーマット、③Google

Sheetの確定には至っていないと理解しますが、何れにせよTITAN Project

Teamへの展開としては、あまり不要に刺激しても仕方がないので、何れにせよTITANを活用する形にしておいた方が良いかと思いました。（という事で、Plan2は不要かと）

P24

\[image: image.png\]

→当方のアイデアとしては、ETL担当者としてWNSから4－5名、

OMMCから2－3名を供給してもらうのが目標です。これに加えて、可能であれば、Evaluationのみならず、TITAN

Teamにも実際に手を動かして頂きまして、サポートして頂けると良いかと思います（加えて、どうしてもOffshore側で対応出来ないものに就いて、ソリューションを考えたりする役割）。また、日本やそれ以外の主要国でも何人か育成できると、今後（他の用途も加味して）を考えると有効かと思います。

これとは別に、WNS側にはManual Entry要員を用意してもらい、ETLで入力しきれないもの（どちらかというと、Reverse

Conversion側の方）に就いて、入力をお願いするような要員を相当程度用意してもらう様なイメージです。

道田

Mitch

## Third-Party System Study to TITAN Format Conversion

受信: Thu Sep 08 2022 17:03:27 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Ryan Dacles \<ryan.dacles@one-line.com\>  
Hi Masuda-san,

Good Day.

Please see the attached files for your requested tender to do some testing

using the 3rd-party system you have introduced at the last meeting.

Below are the information for your perusal:

\*Account Name:\* PANASONIC (Main)

\*Initial Findings by GTM:\* Not Workable in TITAN

\*Challenges:\*

1\. Tender files are separated in multiple sheets.

2\.  Merging all of the data into one working file will result in a huge

number of lanes (approx. 20k lanes)

3\. Total lanes is around 20k in Horizontal format alone, TITAN will be

converting those tender lanes into Vertical format (TITAN standard format)

so expect the number of tender lanes will be doubled/tripled from the

original numbers.

4\. It has NOR (Non-Operating Reefer) lanes and TITAN cannot handle those

cargo types that are in horizontal format as of this time (Enhancement is

not yet developed to handle that type of case).

I will try to look for some other accounts with other blockers such as with

Data Validation, Location groupings, drop-down list, etc.

\*Account Name:\* DAICEL

\*Initial Findings by GTM:\* Not Workable in TITAN

\*Challenges:\*

1\. It has Data validation/Multiple tabs/Macro format.

2\. Data validated cells \- File is formatted in "Macro" so that all inputs

are validated once all required sheets are completed.

2\. Titan Error message: "Failed to save file map."

I will try to look for some other accounts with other blockers such as with

Data Validation, Location groupings, drop-down list, etc. and share it with

you also.

Thank you\!

## Fwd: Third-Party System Study to TITAN Format Conversion

寺田さん

遅くなってすみません。

TITAN unworkableのテンダーについて3例共有いたします。

・Panasonic→Ryanからのメールを参照ください。尚、NORのファイルが含まれていなかったため送付を依頼中です。

・Daicel→Ryanからのメールを参照ください。

・JKC→こちらも上記2例と似ているのですが、複数シートの統合とデータの持ち方の変換が不可でTitanに取り込みできない原因になります。

尚、こちら側の検証の状況ですが、Alteryxで上記3つのTenderのUnstracturedの変換はできまして、Titan

readableのフォーマットにはなりました。現在実際にTitanに取り込みの検証を進めております。ただし、Panasonicは最終的に取り込みレーンが6万行になってしまい、性能的にTitanでは難しいのではということが見えてきております。

不明な点がありましたらご連絡ください。

よろしくお願い致します。

ご共有頂きありがとうございます。

まずは、JKCに関してテストしてみました

・こちらの手元では、GsheetにてUNIONするファイルを作成してみましたので共有させて頂きます

（Offshoreの場合はAlteryxに慣れればAlteryx使用で問題ないかとは思います）

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kMh6bZ-6SEA923CdQyLtlj1u8jiaM-Mibq\_6pcL0Wkw/edit\#gid=2047557389

・JNCの様に、題名ラベルが複数行に分かれるケースが散見されたので、Conversion

Gsheetもアップデートさせて頂きましたので合わせて共有させて頂きます

ですが、

・Origin側のTerm（CY/DOOR）の記載がないように見受けられますが、この場合は全体でCYといった指定になりましょうか

・Container Typeについても記載がないように見受けられますが、この場合は全体でDRといった指定になりましょうか

こちらのTender Sheetについて、ざっと見てみましたが、

・Origin側のTermは、おそらくCYを指しているのかと思います。

・Container Type/SizeはHorizotalで持っている形でしょうかね。

早速ありがとうございます。

\*Origin Term\*

一括で入力できるオプションを持つようにします

\*Container Type (Size)\*

確かに記載ありますね。失礼しました。

一旦、Container SizeがHorizontalの場合と、一括でTypeを入力できるオプションを設けました。

一方で、RFも並列で持つシートが出てきたら（あり得るとすればNVOCCでしょうか）、、要検討かと思います

ありがとうございます。承知致しました。

方法としては、そこまで難しくはなく、

全RouteをDR/RFどちらもありと指定することで、全Routeを倍増させて、DR/RFの列を作成は可能かと思いますが、

いたずらに行が増えすぎる気もしており、一度該当するテンダーにぶつかったときにアップデートさせて頂く様にできればとは思います。

## Re: Third-Party System Study to TITAN Format Conversion

受信: Mon Sep 19 2022 19:59:34 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Ryan Dacles \<ryan.dacles@one-line.com\>  
\*Hi Masuda san,\*

Apology for the late reply.

Please see the Manual Conversion results that I have made for the

account DAICEL in which I succeeded in uploading it in the TITAN system,

but with the below procedures and challenges that I have used and

encountered which kindly see below.

Kindly note that Pricer's quotation part and reverse conversion was not yet

done in this trial. I will go on with that for the next step.

\*Procedures taken:\*

1\. Added POL Country, POD Country, and Preferred Service column as the POL

and POD country is mandatory. This is missing in the file.

\[image: image.png\]

2\. Changed the column header DTHC to THD and DDOC to DOF to avoid conflict

with TITAN existing header label.

\[image: image.png\]

3\. Set Surcharge columns and other customer columns that has no

corresponding mapping column to \*Editable \-\> Pricer\*

4.There are ports that needs to specify offering port location

\[image: image.png\]

5\. After mapping, in the Update Missing Data part, there are some ports

that do not have equivalent values in the TITAN and with incorrectly

generated by the system hence I seek google search assistance to check the

actual ports to be used (This one will take time as you need to check those

items one by one).

6\. Lastly, I still used the original tender file as a reference

simultaneously with the converted ETL tool file to keep in touch with the

actual customer format and to see the dropdown list if there's any. At the

same time, I also check the previous year's file to see what kind of data

the pricers or TST have used for the specific columns for deeper

understanding.

7\. I used the ETL Tool converted file as the uploaded file to TITAN without

adding any unique IDs as we are trying to see if the ETL tool can convert

the tender back to its original file format without that.

\*Challenges encountered:\*

1\. Inputting the dropdown values for POL and POD. Original value is in

3-letter codes but we need to convert it first to actual port names as

TITAN cannot convert it automatically in the dropdown list. If the customer

does have this data, we need to refer to that.

2\. Filling in Dropdown list values takes much time as we need to get the

correct dropdown values following the format of the customer's file in the

correct placements.

3\. Need to ensure that when doing the mapping, focus only on the mapping as

the system may suddenly restart and the work may not be saved. TITAN has a

maximum active time and it will restart once inactive so the user must be

focused and only do the mapping till completion.

4\. Mapping of the customer column may need some knowledge from the account

handler as we cannot just map the column without understanding its usage

and who will input the information in the column.

5\. While confirming the mapping, I encountered this error:

\[image: image.png\]

OTSV suggested changing the column header of the customer's file format to

a different header label \*temporarily \*to avoid header conflicts with the

TITAN header label as the system will prompt it as an error.

6\. There are invalid ports (Import country do not have the correct Final

Delivery point, for this case, user may need to check with CKAM what to use

in actual but since this is just a trial, I just use a dummy information)

\*Summary/Conclusion:\*

\- We can consider using this ETL tool to convert files with multiple sheets

and multiple tabs into a single uploading file to TITAN.

\- ETL tool can be reliable to make the consolidation of files easier and

faster for the user such as in the case of Panasonic and Daicel.

\- However, usage of the original customer format may still be needed

specially during the mapping in TITAN as reference.

\- When there's a dropdown value from the customer, we need to provide it

along with the ETL tool file to the user to be used in the dropdown list

value. For this case I used the original tender file to get those dropdown

list information.

As I have shared, the process was only for the initial Manual Conversion, I

will now input pricer's part to complete the testing up to the reverse

conversion.

See the file that I have used to upload.

Thank you\!

Hi Masuda san,

Good Evening.

Apology for late coming back for the TITAN output result for account DAICEL.

Actually, I just finished it just now as I need to wait for the system to

complete the process.

One of the reasons for the delay was due to the system response time as

well as validation for customer's ports that TITAN cannot identify.

Anyway, I already raised those concerns to the OTSV to attend to the issue

urgently as it really affects the velocity of the user to complete the task.

I believe they are working with it now as per checking with them.

One of the main challenges while doing this is the population of dummy

information for Pricer's part

as the information should be inline with the customers dropdown list,

relevant with the tender lane, and should also be acceptable to TITAN too.

However, while doing this testing, TITAN cannot reflect the values coming

from the excel file after using the 'Download/Upload Excel' Function of

TITAN.

After I work on the excel file and upload it back to TITAN, I need to wait

for an hour or two just to complete the process but unfortunately no value

is reflected in the screen hene I do some workarounds below:

1\. I copy the value directly from the excel file to the TITAN screen column

by column and this really takes a lot of loading time just to reflect the

value not including the validation yet.

2\. After successfully pasting the information I need to hit the 'Save

draft' button first to ensure that my data will be saved first as the

system may suddenly screen timeout due to long loading time.

3\. Once all of the information is saved in the TITAN screen, I hit the

Validate and Save, which I need to do repeatedly due to following reasons:

        a. TITAN sudden screen time out and will not validate and save the

information

        b. TITAN validates acceptable values and reflects in the Error

column the columns that need to be completed or corrected.

There are also ports that cannot be recognized by TITAN hence I set a No

quote reason for the sake of uploading purposes. This No quote reason is

still possible in actual scenario as the Pricer may not want to quote for

the portpair.

The portpairs in our trial are for all trades and we are not fully aware of

the conditions and the port pair handling of the actual Pricers for other

trades hence we atleast make the dummy information relevant and as much as

possible realistic.

Moreover, I am also doing the current procedure of manual conversion for

DAICEL too as part of our deep-dive analysis of Tender Management accounts

simultaneously with our feasibility study.

See the attached file for the Converted TITAN format back to customers and

hope it would work using the ETL tool.

Thank you\! Good night.

Hi @Kazuki Masuda \-san cc Mr. @Kiwhang Nam

Allow me to ask for some scenarios:

\* 

What status are users allowed to download Excel files in Tiger format?

\* 

There are 3 statuses: Initial, Request for Quote, and Quoted

\* 

To me, I think we can allow on all 3 statuses. We don’t need to limit ourselves at the beginning.

\* 

What tender round are users allowed to download Excel files in Tiger format?

\* 

I suggesting disable the function on tender Round 2, Round 3 as subsequent round not accepted by Tiger yet

Thank you @Kazuki Masuda and Mr. @Kiwhang Nam  
We will not limit anything.  
There is a minor thing about the UI but need to heads up to you.  
While the developers built the file, there is some discrepancy between the sample file and the real file downloaded from Titan:

\* 

The DATA SEQ will stand before the column EFFECTIVE DATE and EXPIRY DATE.

\* 

Some columns will have different colors from the sample

To me, I don’t think it is causing a problem. Is it ok if we keep it that way?

皆様、

先日ご相談させて頂きました通り、以下の通りDYMとして幾つかのDecision

Makingを行う予定です。これに関連して、BPITの皆様には、幾つかのお願いをさせて頂きますので、お手数ですが宜しくご協力の程、お願い申し上げます。少し冗長ではありますが、内容を取り纏めましたので、ご査収お願い申し上げます。

ご不明な点ございましたら、何なりとご質問下さい。

\*TITAN Project\*

\*（現状認識）\*

現時点の機能でFull

Automatedの対応出来る顧客は、全体の10％程度。それ以外の30－40％は、マニュアル作業を噛ませることで、TITANへのUploadとその後の処理が可能との結果。それ以外については、顧客ファイルが複雑であり（複数シートだったり、ファイルに計算式が入っていたり、セルを統合していたり等）、現状の機能では対応出来ず。

また、上述の30－40％の所謂、Titan

Workableについても、ケースによっては相当程度のマニュアル作業となりそうで、Onshore側からは対応が難しいとの声が多数挙がっている状況。

これまでのProject側の方針としては、できる限り機能開発で、上述のUnstructuralとして対応が難しいとされる顧客フォーマットへの対応を図るとともに、マニュアル対応については、情宣用のTutorial

Video等でOnshore側への展開を図り、TITANの使用拡大を目指してきた。

\*（今後の方向性）\*

Yield Management DX Master Planで謳っている通り、長期契約更改プロセスにおける、所謂Eagle

Xの導入は不変。即ち、顧客から受容するTemplateを如何に素早くかつ包括的に、OpusのTemplateに変換し、これを使って下流側できめ細かなPricingを行うかが鍵となる。後者については、後述のTIGERの機能拡張が検討されているが、前者については、TITANを含めて如何にDigitizationを進めるかがポイント。現状の機能及び、顧客Templateの複雑多岐性を勘案すると、全てをTITANで対処する事に拘る必要はないかと判断。より柔軟性を持ったOptionを用意することで、すべての顧客のDigitizationを図り、後続のPricing

Processの高速化及び精緻化を図る事を新たな目標とする。

\*（短期対応策）\*

2023年度契約交渉準備に向けて、以下の対応策を立案し、実施に向けた検討を直ちに行う。

①、TITANについては、現行機能で対応できるもののみを対象とする（全体の10％程度）

②、それ以外については、Pricing Template（早々に定義を完了予定）への入力を図る。

③、②については、以下のパターンに応じて対応策を検討

ⅰ Onshore対応（レーン数が少ない平易なもの）

ⅱ Offshore対応（含む、ETLを活用した半自動化プロセス）

ⅲ Offshore対応（完全マニュアルプロセス）

④、③のⅱ及びⅲに対応する為に、Template

Conversion専門の部隊を設置。業務の内容及び季節波動性から勘案するに、WNSへの業務委託が最も適切と判断。且つ、ⅱについては、RPAで培った技術的な知見が活用できる見込みであり、この部分も含めてWNSに部隊の組成を依頼したい。即ち、個別の顧客フォーマットを読み解きつつ、これにある程度の半自動化プロセス（例えば、縦持ちを横持ちに変換する等）を噛ませつつ、最後はマニュアル対応で、OPUSのPricing

Templateへの転換（逆転換も含めて）をプロセス化する。

但し、顧客フォーマットは千差万別の為、個別対応とならざるを得ず、従い組織を組成した暁には、直ちに前回使用した顧客テンプレートをベースに、対応プロセスを個別に作成し、実際のTender

Seasonが始まる迄に、一通りの準備を完了させておく事となる。

対象件数は、現在大凡の数字を検証中なるも、正確な数字には1ヶ月程度が必要と思われる。

現時点のBallpark Numberは初期対象で、約500件程度（最終的には1,000件程度）

一部リージョンでは、Onshore側でのHandlingを好むケースもあり（言語対応及び精度を不安視して）、当該件数は流動的。特に、日本やアジアは、レーン数が多くてもOnshore対応を選択する可能性が高い（全てではないが）。

別途、英文にて当該業務のOffshore化及び対応するWNSの要因確保と組織設営依頼を、DYMから送付予定（宛：BPIT関係者）。既に、Pei

Yee及びOlafには、上述の概略を口頭で説明済み。趣旨についても、ご理解頂いている状況。（尚、件数については未だシェアしておりません）

尚、当該Template Conversion Teamについては、業務の進捗状況の把握、プロセスの共有、Best

Practiceの展開、Onshore側との連携管理等を、TITAN

Projectチームに要員を配置し、POの元で全体管理を行う事を想定。一義的には、BPIT側の担当者（Pei

Yee及びOlaf）の管掌となるが、ビジネス側として運用面に就いて、TITAN Project

チームをオーナーとしてアポイント予定。また、BPITと連携して、対象顧客の選定及び、顧客テンプレートの収集、アセスメントの進捗管理、半自動化プロセスの検討（ETL等活用）、マニュアル対応人数の検討、WNSとのService

Level Agreementの設定、進捗管理ツールの導入（Service Now?）等を行う予定。

以上の方針に従い、TITANのBacklogについては、現状抱えているPerformance問題（取り込みに数十分掛かるケースあり）、及び下流のプライシングプロセスを司るTIGERとのAPI連携の2点に絞り込み、それ以外については原則Suspendを行う予定。これに伴い、10月以降の開発要員体制の見直しが急務となる。現時点で、MTIからのサポート要員及びTraineeも含めて、15名の開発部隊をOTSV側に構えているが、相当数の人員については、他のプロジェクトへの配置転換が必要な見込み。

\*（中長期対応策）\*

2023年度契約交渉向けのプロセスについては、上述の通りなるも、それ以降については、TITANの存在意義も含めてReviewを行う予定。現状の認識では、顧客Templateの取り込みも含めた自動化を達成しているのは、全体の10%に過ぎず、この部分の強化を図るには、自前の開発よりは、既存の便利機能（ETL）を活用した個別対応が適していると考えられる。具体的には、Alteryxや、Tableau

Prep等が候補に挙がるが、何れにせよ取り込み前のファイルの整形は、TITAN外で行うのが合理的と判断。そのうえで、OPUSへのCode

ConversionのみをTITANの機能として残す事も考えられるが、顧客Template↔ETL↔TITAN↔TIGER（for

Pricing）というデータ連携を行うことに、どこまでのメリットがあるかは疑問なしとはせず。ETL側にOPUSへのCode

Conversion機能を付与する事も検討できると考えており、双方のオプションを検討する必要がある。

\*TIGER Project\*

\*（現状認識）\*

上述の、Eagle X

Projectの展開に合わせて、TIGERに長期契約運賃作成のための仕掛けづくりを、この4月から進めてきた。要件については、長期契約更改の内容がこれまでにTIGERで対応してきた、短期契約及びSpot対応と比較して非常に複雑で、且つ適用範囲も大きいため、GHQ

Trade/Marketingとの議論を重ねて、一から作り上げたために、非常に時間が掛かってしまっている状況。実際にも、既存のTIGERの機能で賄いきれないものが非常に多く、開発の規模感としても相当程度となっている。これとは別に、開発部隊であるCLTとの議論がスムーズに進まない事が多く、進捗が捗々しくなかったため（依頼要件を伝える会議に時間を割かれ、より要件定義が進まないジレンマ）、急遽DX

Master

Plan全体のPMOを担うPwCをAssignして、取り纏め作業や進捗確認等を依頼した。一定程度の改善は見られたものの、システム設計の細かい点の議論まで進んできたので、CLTの開発部隊とのセッションは、TIGER

Heartに任せ、PwCには全体の進捗管理及びContingency Plan策定に傾注してもらう事となった。

現時点に於いては、要件定義も一段落して、ほぼ全ての（一部のデータ分析が未了で定義しきれない部分もあるが）依頼は提出済み。一方で、7月に提出した非常にラフなアイデアに基づいて、ある程度の開発は進んでいるものの、それ以降に追加要件定義したものについては、これからの開発となるために、2023年度の契約更改に向けた開発スケジュールは、残念ながら大幅な遅延を余儀なくされている状況。当初は、コア機能に絞って投入及び活用を検討したが、寧ろユーザー側の混乱を助長しかねないとの懸念もあり、2023年度向けの契約更改への投入は断念し、Contingency

Planへの転換を決定。

\*（短期対応策）\*

Contingecy

Planへの転換を決定したことで、現在走ってる開発については同じペースを継続しつつも（なるべく早いタイミングでのリリースは必要）、これ以外にPendingとなっているTIGER開発案件との兼ね合いについても、再度検討事項となる。即ち、これまでは長期契約更改用の機能開発を優先してきたが、このペースを継続しつつも、直近必要なそれ以外の開発がある場合は、ある程度考慮する事ができる状況となった。

これとは別に、盛んにCLT側からConcernsとして挙げられる点について、抜本的なアクションを検討する必要があると思量。即ち、小手先でスペックダウン（ビジネス側が一部要件を諦める）を図るのではなく、根本的なパフォーマンス向上に向けた取り組みを同時並行で行うことで、ユーザーの満足度を上げる事が肝要と考えられ、この部分でBPIT就中、ACのAssessmentをお願いしたい。

また、現状認識にある通り、Waterfallの開発プロセスでは、この手の走りながら要件定義及び開発していくスキームとは相性が悪く、今後のプロジェクトの体制についても検討が必要かと思われる。

これとは別に、Contingency

Planとして、要件定義で挙げた内容の内、コアと思われる部分をTIGERに頼らずに実行する方向で準備していくこととなった。取り急ぎ、機能及び対応するプロセスの概略を取り纏めるとともに、エクセルを活用した計算ファイルを組み上げてPOCを実施しているところ。但し、データのつなぎ合わせ（顧客ごとの契約情報、Customerからの情報、Game

Plan情報、TT Toolの情報、Pricing

Simulationの情報等）については、データ量も多く、Cloud側でのConfigurationが適切かと思うので、このためのGCP環境（OPUSからのデータのブリッジも含めて）の設定を、早急にBPIT/ACに依頼予定。

\*（中長期対応策）\*

TIGERでの開発を、要件定義通りに進める予定なるも、Perfromance改善の取り組みや既存のBacklog対応も含めて、総合的に勘案して進める予定。

Agile体制への転換等も合わせて検討課題。

\*（TO DO案件）\*

## Conversion Process Enhancement in Offshore

受信: Thu Sep 08 2022 12:28:32 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) / From: Kenichi Michida \<kenichi.michida@one-line.com\>  
Eagle X 関係者各位、

本日、BPITのOffshore管理部隊（Pei Yee,

Olaf）と打ち合わせを行いまして、以下を確認しましたので、ご報告申し上げます。これをベースに、資料を準備し、各部門への展開を検討したいと思います。

＊現在OnshoreでHandleしている契約の内、大型のものをOffshoreに展開して、Conveersion作業を行う部隊をWNSに設置するように依頼（此処に至った経緯も説明済）

＊High level processについては当方で準備して、先方への展開を予定（for WNS）

＊BPITがUnofficialにWNSにアプローチして、上述のアイデア及び準備可能かどうかを検討

＊当方から、本件の依頼を正式に文書でBPITに送付（for BPIT management）

＊別途、Business側で当該アイデアを正式に提案し、GCSM（Tender Management Team）の了承を得た上で、各RHQに展開

＊その上で、どの契約がOffshoreに回すかを検討。具体的に契約数等を把握し、検討対象の契約をOffshoreに展開し、Evaluation

Processを進める

＊WNS側の要員準備のために、10件程度の顧客フォーマットをBPIT経由でWNSに展開し、Shadow Playを行う。

＊WNS側の作業を行う前に、どのフォーマットでOutputを出すかを決める必要あり（Titan Format or Tiger Format）

＊Titanの今後の扱いについては、現時点ではDiscloseするべきことはないが、方向性についてはシェア済（何れにせよ、Titan

Project内で方向性を確認するまではDiscloseしないように依頼済）

＊このConversion部隊については、既存のWNSのTender

Management部隊とは別組織。後者は、Conversion以外のTender対応全般を行っており（on behalf of

Onshore）、Role\&Responsiblityが相違するため。

＊Conversionについては、Manual及びAutomation（ETLを活用）のConbinationで対応予定。かつ、顧客毎で対応策は個別対応

＊ASAPでWNS側の準備を進め、Tender Seasonが始まる前までに、各顧客の対応策を準備しておく予定。

＊Track出来るように、Service Now（には限らないが）等を活用して、受領日や進捗状況を管理するための仕掛けを検討。

＊主としてターゲットは、欧米のOnshore顧客（既にOffshore化されているものは継続）となるため、作業時間も欧米時間に合わせるのが最もPracticalと考えられる。

これとは別に、LA

BPMと確認を行い、LA側が確認している48顧客（より小型の契約はもっとあると思われますが）の内、30についてはOffshoreへの移管を決めていると。残りの18がOnshore側に残るものとなり、これについて個別のTutorial（Titanを使うかどうかは別にして）を行うことで、より迅速なConversion及び後続のPricing

Processに繋げることを想定。

寺田さん、増田さん、

スイマセン。

途中で、会議から離脱してしまいまして申し訳ございませんでした。

本件ですが、北米側でのセッションでも、大きな懸念点として挙げられており（詳細まで話をした訳ではありませんが）、これを打開するための仕掛けづくりは待ったなし、という所ですので、早いタイミングで方向性を確定させた上で、準備作業に入りたいと思います。仕掛けづくり、対応する組織編成、要員確保といったところが最重要課題かと思いますので、宜しくお願い申し上げます。

道田

Best regards,

Mitch

寺田さん、

はい、当方の意図としましては、お電話でも申し上げました通り、できるだけ早いタイミングで、欧米の一定上の規模のOnshore

ContractをOffshore側で検証してもらい、それぞれのフォーマットを理解した上で、事前に対応策を個別に準備するようなイメージです。

ある程度、Google SheetやETLを活用しつつも、難しい部分はManual

Workで対応するような、Hybridタイプの対応策になるかと考えております（勿論、ETLで対応出来るのであればそれに越したことはないですが）。

道田

寺田さん

返信遅くなり申し訳ありません。

投影したメモをお送りします。

1点ご相談がありまして、PJ内でAlteryx DesignerのFeasibility study（POC）を試してみたいと考えております。

具体的には、下記を含むいくつかTitan unworkableなTenderをピックアップしてみて、Alteryx

Designerでフローが組めるか、組む場合どれくらい時間がかかるか検証してみたいと思っております。

   \- 縦持ち・横持ちデータのピポット

   \- 複数シートのヘッダが同じ場合のデータのUnion

   \- 複数シートでヘッダが異なる場合のデータを結合してマージ（キーがない

   \- 場合は要検討）

   \- グループロケーションの⾏の分割

   \- Titan⽅向性3

   \- （Simplified formatを使う場合は）列の並び替え

そのため、PJ内にAlteryxのノウハウがないため、PwC様の中で

Alteryx に詳しい方に上記機能の使い方を一度PJメンバーにレクチャーいただくことが可能かどうかご検討いただけないでしょうか。

※ライセンスは2週間のトライアルライセンスを使用してみて、その間に本格的に進めるかどうか検討したいと考えております。

※まだAlteryxに決めたわけではなく、Google sheetやTableau

prep等も同時に検討したいと考えておりますが、まずはAlteryxをクイックに試してみたいと考えております。

不明な点がありましたらご指摘ください。

ご検討のほど、よろしくお願い致します。

増田

寺田さん

もろもろ共有いただきまして誠にありがとうございます。

まずは1個私のほうでTitan

unworkableなTenderを選んでみて、Alteryxで変換かけてTitanに取り込むというプロセスを検証してみようと思います。

その結果をもとにまた相談させていただければと思います。

Tableau

prepの経験は過去にあるのでETLの肌感はあるのですが、Alteryxの細かいところで躓いてしまった場合、質問させいただけると幸いです。

よろしくお願い致します。

ありがとうございます。はい。何なりとご連絡下さい。

なお、明日も今後のコンチプランのタスクとしてお話しさせて頂ければと存じますが、

並行して、TITANで作業困難なテンダーについて、Manual Conversionでも対応準備ができればと思っております。

そこで大変お手数ではございますが、

各イレギュラーケースの事例について、例示をご教示頂くこと可能でしょうか。

テンダー自体は下記にて共有頂いておりますので、事例ごとにどのテンダーなのかをご教示頂けると幸いです。

私もこれからTitanのメンバーに上記事例を含むUnstructured
