### ECM（Execution Marketing）の状況

#### Central China

**AX2**:
- **Week 47 MCVT**: 
  - **Ningbo**: Final pickup to report、pickup improvement compared last week、till today morning already picked up around 499 TEUs、maximum maybe 550 TEUs、show up around 60%（phone booking maximum 900 TEUs、final pickup maybe 550 TEUs）
  - **Shanghai**: No much roll、at least can BSA、both still can fully load BSA but no roll
  - **Generally**: Hardly to create roll on North China、at least follow obviously
- **Week 48 KDDD**: 
  - **Shanghai**: Almost no booking（already advanced as much as possible to MCBT）
  - **Ningbo**: Fresh booking already around 1,048 TEUs for fresh booking、this voyage can also enjoy the GRI last week public、show up at least will be same as Week 47（at least 40%）、forecast 450 TEUs（compare fresh booking and show up ratio）
  - **Shanghai**: Has almost no booking、all BSA will share to Ningbo much more as much possible
  - **Qingdao**: Exercise booking as much、AX3 BK already give most around 1,000 TEUs total booking（include AX1/2/3/4）、H2 can connect as 200 TEUs、if can more but also advance if can seek more、with pickup total pickup already over BK give number、maybe after meeting check with you how much extra still can give
  - **Qingdao**: At least can fill out BSA no problem、still need more、if can give squeeze some more can more and more product
  - **Changsha**: Can fall out at least on this voyage、next voyage will face some ways、may not fall out BSA on next week 48、but Week 48 still can fall out
  - **Generally**: Central China still can load which is same as Week 47、turn over for now still very hard this is Week 48

**AX1**:
- **Week 49 Shanghai**: Pickup is very good、till today already picked up around 625 TEUs、Shanghai has no SE open yet、forecast very high、already around 700 TEUs、compare BSA side have at least will have at 100 for but maybe also no need a low because have other P or other have some for make a lot more
- **Week 49 Ningbo**: Due to Ningbo as December which means highly chance will catch the GRI、for booking Ningbo just can fulfill BSA and much roll can go to this or impact vessel
- **Week 49 Qingdao/Changsha**: Qingdao/Changsha just can't have enough booking out here、strong booking one Shanghai and one is Qingdao、but Qingdao strong booking also bottleneck is AX3 because this voyage AX3 is on the TK（end of November for vessel）、customers still can enjoy the till of November rate to capture this big vessel、but still not sure how much we pour on this AX3 how much AX3 can give to the AX1/2/3 especially especially for AX2 vessel how much they can give for AX2 side、maybe Elyn will check with VK how much we pour can give especially for AX2 can give how much because who need to face Ningbo and may need more especially may need more Qingdao

**AX3**:
- **Week 46 ZAMT**: Vessel have delay around 8 days in China、but this vessel still full、have 100 roll from Shanghai、last week expect that will have 200 from China but due to MRG decrease big shortfall from China、finally don't have any over on this vessel just because rate decrease
- **Week 47**: Vessel Shanghai and Ningbo already closed、also vessel will delay in China、but have weight issue start from this vessel、yesterday BK gave maximum weight is not enough、still need 4,000 metric tons、really push N to see we got more wayport space、they will check and get back to us、as much as possible because AX1/2/4 all need Qingdao to push that for AX3 bookings、we don't need we pour if we pour tight can do local shutdown but for one two four these three loops need function、for this vessel currently well no roll from China as well because put everything to push first to connect one to four Week 48
- **Week 48 TKHT**: This vessel is the last vessel before GRI、currently can draw bookings from China、even released 900 bookings still have pending booking over 1,300、but due to weight limitation may not release these bookings、need at least 20,000 metric tons at least for this week's Shanghai who already know space on
- **Week 49**: Will no weight issue from China because will have extra weight space from F3 and also apply the spare weight space from GS2、for this vessel may create 100 TEUs from China、currently bookings are still okay for show up AX3、have confidence to fulfill this vessel

**AX4**:
- **Week 47 PMXT**: Current check don't have confidence to fulfill this vessel because from booking not so strong、Hai changed vessel two days ago one days ago or two days ago so maybe even send email to sales but maybe still some confused by sales or customers、don't think have cargo can shift from other loops because on Week 47 don't have roll、on current forecast may do 70% of BSA、70% maybe can do、later can check but well not maybe within 80% of tonnage weight for this vessel have larger BSA than before、Week 50 currently booking still good mostly are previous roll over from this to connect the HIIT、booking still good

**Show Up率**:
- **After rate reduce**: AX2 see show up is 62%、but for AX1 only around 50-55%
- **Average**: About 50-60%

### 市場レートの状況

#### 11月のレート
- **現状**: Rate still workable until end of November
- **ONEのレート**: Still aggressive in November、this week rate still good in market

#### 12月のGRI
- **Evergreen**: 1,500 GRI for first week of December
- **Costco**: 1,000 GRI for first week of December
- **CMA/MSE**: Want to push around 1,000 level but no official notice
- **ONE High**: Also announced for December

#### 市場利用率
- **Qingdao**: Market all roll around 10-20%
- **Shanghai**: Have heavy roll in hand
- **Wan Hai/MSC**: Full of little roll
- **Evergreen**: Full but no roll
- **Costco/CMA**: Marginal full、still over received bookings
- **CMA**: Around 95% utilization
- **Costco**: Around 90% utilization

#### 12月のGRI戦略

**決定事項**:
- **FAK**: 2,500（WCSA 2,600、Mexico 2,500）
- **Tier 1**: 2,300
- **Gap**: $200 gap（FAK 2,500、Tier 1 2,300）
- **理由**: 
  - Many carrier FAK is paper、ours is workable
  - Don't want to have too huge gap
  - To push for more Mexico volume、need to have gap so that will induce more Mexico

**12月の市場見通し**:
- **Blank sailings**: 
  - Week 49: AA5 blank sailing Shanghai in EGD Shanghai on December 3rd
  - Week 50: WSA3 EGD Shanghai on December 14th also have blank sailing
  - Week 52: AA5 EGD Shanghai on December 24th will also have blank sailing
  - Costco will have three blank sailings in December
  - Hapag will also have blank sailing on their Z service on November 30 and also ZC on December 2
  - F4 will also have two blank sailings in December
- **Supply decrease**: December will have some burden supply decrease which can also support the GRI
- **Optimistic**: Manifested for to implement this GRI in December

### 重要なポイント

#### Show Up率の改善
- **現状**: 40%から50-55%に改善
- **理由**: 
  1. Rate adjustment
  2. December GRI post back
- **標準**: 50%が一般的（most of customer for LAWC trade especially for those NVO will place booking first、in case if they have name account on can they will place booking first based on ratio、since we always can release AP only sometimes especially for those vessel when vessel very tight、overall if generally think normal show up for us for south PRC maybe 50% the same it think it's general show up ratio in case when up and down and even market diff problem and rate not good enough so ratio will be dropped down to around 14% something like that）

#### 12月のGRI実装
- **理由**:
  1. Current rate is very low level、every carrier have big wish to increase rate to be vendable level
  2. December is season that need to negotiate with long-term contract、if keep rate in very low level every long-term contract their request rate maybe were at around 1,300 or 1,400 and that is too low affirmatively cannot accept
  3. Supply decrease in market（blank sailings）

#### レート設定の判断
- **FAK**: 2,500（WCSA 2,600、Mexico 2,500）
- **Tier 1**: 2,300
- **Gap**: $200 gap
- **理由**: To push for more Mexico volume、need to have gap
